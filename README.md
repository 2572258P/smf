# Overview
The aim of this project is to find mates on the system "Study Mates Finder". Many international students and some local students have struggled to study in a solo environment. Therefore, this system plans to provide an environment to make a healthy and dense network among students. 
For example, native English-speaking students who want to strengthen their programming skillsets in python, then they can find "study mates" who have good skillsets in python but want to be better at speaking English skills.
