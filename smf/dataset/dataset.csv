It's a collection of her photos -- about 80 pages worth with a nice section of paintings by Olivia.If you're looking for heavy literary content, this isn't the place to find it -- there's only about 2 pages with text and everything else is photos.Bottom line: if you only want one book, the Six Foot One ... is probably a better choice, however, if you like Julie like I like Julie, you won't go wrong on this one either."
1,"I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations."
2,"If people become the books they read and if ""the child is father to the man,"" then Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel) is the most influential author, poet, and artist of modern times. For me, a daddy to a large family who learned to read with Dr. Seuss and who has memorized too many of the books via repeated readings to young children, Prof. Nel's brilliant 'American Icon' is a long awaited treat. At last a serious treatment of this remarkable genius that is both an engaging read and filled with remarkable insights! I especially enjoyed (and learned more than I care to admit from) Prof. Nel's discussions of the Disneyfication of Seuss - which Nel links to failings in American copyright law, ""the other sides of Dr. Seuss"" - all of which sides were new to me, and the political genesis of his secular morality in the WWII cartoon work he did at PM magazine. The chapters on Geisel's poetry and artwork and the link Nel makes between Seuss and the historical avant guarde alone make this book a ""must buy"" for parents and serious readers, not to mention public libraries. Readers of Nel's other books will find the same engaging writing style that makes the book a fun read while imparting a mountain of information and important ideas. This is simply the best and most comprehensive book yet written on the work of Seuss Geisel and what will certainly be the standard for many years to come. Thank you, Prof. Nel, wherever you are, from a reader who grew up with the good doctor and who is growing up with him again years later. Your book, written from your encyclopeadic knowledge of children's literature and the media of this genre - from scanning verse to cubist painting! - explains the power, limits, and popularity of the Seuss phenomenon."
3,"Theodore Seuss Geisel (1904-1991), aka &quot;Dr. Seuss,&quot; was one of the most influential writers and artists of the 20th century.In 1959, Rudolf Flesch wrote, &quot;A hundred years from now, children and their parents will still eagerly read the books of a fellow called Ted Geisel, popularly known as Dr. Seuss.&quot;Flesch was too conservative in his prediction. A century, and more, from today, Dr. Seuss will still be read when many authors on today's bestseller lists will be forgotten.Published on the centenary of Geisel's birth, Dr. Seuss: American Icon analyzes six key aspects of Seuss's career: poetry, politics, art, biography, marketing, and influence.In six insightful chapters, Philip Nel, Assistant Professor of English at Kansas State University, discusses &quot;U.S. Laureate of Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Dr. Seuss vs. Adolf Hitler,&quot; &quot;The Doc in the Smock,&quot; &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. S.,&quot; &quot;The Disneyfication of Dr. Seuss,&quot; and &quot;The Cat in the Hat for President.&quot;Nel gives short shrift to Geisel's childhood and family background--and, indeed, to biography in general--preferring to focus on Seuss's writing and art, from his first book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) to his last book, Oh, the Places You'll Go! (1990).Dr. Seuss's breakthrough year was 1957, when he published the two books with which he is most often identified: The Cat in the Hat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Other classic works in the Seussian canon are: Horton Hears a Who! (&quot;A person's a person, no matter how small&quot;), Yertle the Turtle (modeled on the rise of Adolf Hitler), Green Eggs and Ham (Seuss's bestselling book), The Sneeches (a criticism of anti-Semitism), The Lorax (a protest against corporate abuse of the environment), and The Butter Battle Book (a critique of Reagan's enthusiasm for the nuclear arms trace).His favorite work, among the books he authored, was The Cat in the Hat, for it, more than any other, taught children to read.While many of his books have a clear and powerful moral, Seuss had a horror of heavy-handed preaching. He sought to teach and ignite the imagination, but was a lifelong opponent of smug, self-righteous bourgeois moralism.&quot;Seuss was a contrarian,&quot; writes Nel, &quot;who enjoyed challenging people to reconsider their assumptions. [He had a] rebellious imagination and a dispositional distaste for rules and regulations.&quot; His work was a &quot;rational insanity&quot; that exhibited &quot;joyous anarchy&quot; and a &quot;lifelong thrill in misbehaving.&quot;A better subtitle for Nel's work would have been American Icon and Iconoclast.Nel tells of Seuss's early years as an advertising artist and as a agitprop cartoonist. The book, however, is not a biography; it is a serious study in the genres of literary and art criticism.For readers who want more biographical information, Nel recommends Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel, by Judith Morgan and Neil Morgan (1995), which he describes as &quot;the definitive biography and the single best secondary source on Seuss. Any discussion of Seuss's life and work must begin with this book.&quot;Dr. Seuss: American Icon includes 103 pages of notes, index, and the most comprehensive annotated Seuss bibliography ever assembled. One learns a lot from this book; the author's lucid style makes it not only an enlightening work but a fun read.Philip Nel is the author of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter Novels: A Reader's Guide (2001) and The Avant-Garde and American Postmodernity (2002).Roy E. Perry of Nolensville, Tennessee, is an advertising copywriter at a Nashville publishing house."
4,"Philip Nel - Dr. Seuss: American IconThis is basically an academic overview of Seuss poetry, art, cartoons, and the problems with the commercialization of the Seuss name and works after his death. It is not, to any real extent, a biography. Those seeking such should move on.As an academic book it leans on the dry side. It assumes the reader has a fairly good knowledge of Children's Literature and 20th Century cartoons (not the animated kind). Not a book to begin your Dr. Seuss experience with. But if you have read them to your children and are interested about the writing style (there is a good chapter about his poetry) or his art style (not as good a chapter, but still interesting).What interested me the most was the deconstruction of the recent rush to ""cash in"" on Seuss by Hollywood and advertisers. I think that Nel wants to come down against it, but based on Seuss' background (he started out drawing Flit ads) and the projects he approved during his lifetime; it is a tough argument to make. In the end though Nel does point out that maybe the movies and tie- ins did not have to be so... crass?The book is well researched; lots of neat tidbits are to be gleamed. Early cartoons by Seuss for PM magazine were occasionally (by today's standards) shockingly racist. It makes him a little more human and puts his latter works like the Lorax in a new light.Those in Education may enjoy this background. Fans of Seuss will enjoy the exhaustive bibliography of Seuss's many, many works. Also good list of other works about the man."
5,"""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" by Philip Nel is a thoughtful deconstruction of the life and work of Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss). In this thoughtful book, Mr. Nel deepens our appreciation for Seuss as a distinctively American poet, artist and educator. The author demonstrates Seuss' wide ranging influence and argues for his rightful place among the most important cultural figures of the 20th century.An English professor at Kansas State University, Mr. Nel uses his historic knowledge to discuss how Seuss' text belongs to a tradition of great nonsense writers. Mr. Nel states that Seuss' carefully-constructed absurdist tales encourage children to challenge the status quo by gently skewering the grown-up world; elsewhere, he uses charts to show how Seuss effectively used meter and rhyme to complement his intentionally ridiculous plots and create masterful stories that have stood up well to the test of time.Mr. Nel recounts Seuss' early career as advertising illustrator and political cartoonist to help us better understand the influences that shaped his classic children's work. As an artist, Mr. Nel suggests that the term ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" appropriately describes Seuss' creative synthesis of cubism, art nouveau, surrealism and other styles. While Seuss' influence can be detected in modern rap music, children's books, political cartoons and more, Mr. Nel contends that Seuss would not have been happy about the manner in which his works have been posthumously marketed, opining that the ""Disneyification"" or simplification of Seuss' stories for marketable purposes ""threatens to make 'Seuss' synomynous with the ambiguous power of global capitalism"". Such commercialism would appear to collide with Seuss' desire to develop critical thinking among young people and to help us all imagine a better world.I highly recommend this book for everyone interested in gaining greater insight and perspective into one of America's greatest creative talents."
6,"Theodor Seuss Giesel was best known as 'Dr. Seuss', one of the most influential and enduringly popular children's authors of the 20th century. Giesel created not only his famous imaginative picturebooks, but a unique art and poetry, and even a place for himself in politics. Philip Nel argues that these added activities make Dr. Seuss one of the most influential people in America - certainly the most influential poet - and Dr. Seuss: American Icon provides the reader an memorably excellent survey of Dr. Seuss' many achievements."
7,"When I recieved this book as a gift for Christmas my first impression went along these line: ""Oh great some professor who probably wrote alot of mumbo-jumbo that I don't want to know about Dr. Suess and I know it won't be an enjoyable read.""Thanks goodness I read it nonetheless.To my pleasure, Nel hardly writes in the airy academia style with which I expected him to. In fact, he's writes so far from it, with a smart and precise style, I am tempted to revise how I feel about professor-writers. However, in accordance with his academia roots, Nel has a 100 page annotated bibliogarphy that goes along with his work, a nice shrine to prove his homework was well done.As far the actual book goes it is an excellent piece work. ""Dr. Seuss: American Icon"" looks at the man behind Dr. Suess not as a straight-forward biography, but rather it focuses on different areas of Dr. Suess (i.e. poet, poetry of, artist, artistic style, adult, activist, etc.) and interjects those discussions with biogrphical anecdotes. A very effective attention keeping method.If you're interested in learning more about the work and the man behind the work of Dr. Suess, this is the book that speaks to both and even more. Highly recommended!"
8,"Trams (or any public transport) are not usually the best place to read and absorb scholarly texts. But this one has accompanied me on my daily commute, and I have been absorbed in it. It is well written and comprehensive, and tells the tale of a modern author, with plenty of ""Fancy that"" and ""Well, well"" moments. Highly recommended for stationary reading, too."
9,"As far as I am aware, this is the first book-length study of the work of Dr. Seuss, and Philip Nel has done an excellent job. If the word 'study' makes you nervous, rest assured: this is not a jargon-filled, pretentious analysis. It is, instead, a nicely written work that views Seuss from several different angles: as a poet, a visual artist, a cartoonist, and so on. Nel writes intelligently on how Seuss fits into the canon of nonsense poets, and provides good background on the roots of Seuss's visual style. Some of the WW2/political cartoon material I had read about before, but Nel covers it thoroughly. The most fascinating chapter to me deals with the marketing of Seuss, particularly since his death. Nel holds forth strongly on the abominable 'Grinch' movie (and I trust he feels the same way about the 'Cat in the Hat' film too), and gets into a very interesting discussion of the possible motivations behind the ever-expanding empire of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. (And no, I don't believe it is purely about the profits!)Two small quibbles prevent me from awarding five stars. Firstly, I would have liked the book to be a little longer. The in-depth bibliography is interesting in itself and will be a goldmine to future researchers, but I'm sure Nel could have found a few more things to say - perhaps about Seuss's gender politics. Secondly, the dust jacket on my copy was a little loose."
10,"I just finished the book, &quot;Wonderful Worship in Smaller Churches,&quot; by David Ray, an outstanding resource for small church pastors, as is his other book, &quot;The Big Small Church Book.&quot; I will be rereading both regularly and referring to them often. I may have to reorder the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; as my copy is nearly worn out. If I had only two choices for resources for pastors of small churches, it would be these two.I hope the author considers focusing on Christian Education in another book. There is a section in the &quot;Big Small Church Book&quot; on Christian Education, but concentrating on one of the most important church functions individually makes a huge difference, as is proven by this new book. I tell all my colleagues that Rev. Ray's books are worth every dollar and more."
11,"Many small churches feel like they can not have great worship because they lack the resources that larger churches take for granted.Ray's list of ""thou shalts"" is worth the price of the book.The description of various ""personalities"" in the small church is both humorous, and so true.This book gives encouragement as well as practical advice."
12,"I just finished reading this amazing book and came away with an entirely different perspective on our smaller congregation. As a ministry leader it is easy to become depressed over what can not be accomplished, and how overworked everyone is in a small church...but we often fail to see all that IS being accomplished and how extraordinary our smaller congregations are.There are many pluses outlined in this book about what works about being smaller, and in this day of mega churches the reminder is a good one. There are some very good tips about altering worship for smaller congregations and valuing it's unique size and working with it well.For the thousands of us who find ourselves in churches with membership of 100 or less, for those who are discouraged when worship attendence is 30 or 40 during the summer, this book is such an uplifting perspective you can't help but be energized!Unlike many tomes of this nature, this is an easy read and the layperson can gobble it up and immediately put it to use. David Ray's writing style is accessible and doesn't make assumptions about the knowledge of the reader, offering explanations where needed that were very helpful.Pick it up even if you are not a pastor, you will gain something from it, I guarantee it!"
13,"I hadn't been a small church pastor very long before I began to hear about David R. Ray. If you do any reading in this area, you'll start to see other authors refer to him and a handful of others, especially Anthony Pappas and Carl Dudley (who are also excellent). But Ray is different. Reading his work, I felt as if he had actually visited MY home church. He describes some of the personalities in a church family, and I could supply their names. He lists some of the ""Thou Shalts"" of a strong worship service, and I heard echoes of my most recent deacons' meeting. He not only gets small church culture, he celebrates it, and he is eager to help small churches learn to get and to celebrate themselves. If you are part of a church where low-morale often coexists with feisty pride, this is a resource that will help. It offers some ways of identifying what church families with 50 or fewer need and hope for from their churches, and how to offer it in ways that are inclusive, warm, fun and authentic. Hallelujah!"
14,"I bought this book because I read some glowing praise on an online library site. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed by page three. I always buy books in the hope and expectation of having an enjoyable read, not to criticise. However, this book is in urgent need of good editing -- though quite possibly editing alone wouldn't save it. Examples: a bed squeaks slightly and sharply in the same sentence; a nightgown hangs freely over her girlish figure and olive colored complexion; coffee aromas huddle; rumbling clouds huddle (as well as the coffee?); she prepared to sip her coffee beneath the wrath of God... cuddled within the arms of a strong breeze; (the wrath of God is a breeze?); the Columbian (stet) coffee aroma danced beneath her sculpted tan nose; the coffee bean fragrance tangoed within her body; she placed her thick pink lips against the warm cup;... and so on, all by page three. It is quite possible that the storyline is deeply moving. I'll never know because I can't bring myself to continue. Sorry."
15,"I have to admit, I am not one to write reviews on book. I do however like to read them. Some of the reviews are great, some are cruel, but the reviews on this book were absolutlely hysterical. I read this book and after watching the war of the words I couldn't help, but to jump in. I am on the good side of the book. I loved how it kept my intersted. On the bad side I have to say, there was a typo featured on the back cover and the secret to liking this book is making it through the first chapter. I have to admit I was a little curious when I read some of the reviews. They were so mean and false that it spiked my curiosity. I then like the last review noticed that the ""Traveling librarian"" wrote a completely ignorant review on this book. My first thought was wait a minute, that was not the book that I read. I read my copy once again and realized her entire review was fabricated. Then I knew, it was some kind of game. Maybe it is someone who dislikes the author for personal reasons, that has posted more then one awful review, or maybe this is another who is jealous, Who knows? All I know is that I liked the book, and future readers take the advice of the ignorant with a grain of salt."
16,"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
17,When I first read this the I was mezmerized at the style of writting. I soon became so hooked on this book that I wanted to fall on my knees and shut out the rest of the world. Haddon delivers a portrayal of a woman that is hurt loney and abused and I think she does a wonderful job making the reader feel like the character.
18,"I read the review directly under mine and I have to say I laughed. How can someone write a honest review on a book they read only three pages of? That was funny but also sad that people are mean enough to keep others from an enjoyable read. I loved this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long, but I read the WHOLE book and I loved it. This book is about an afair of the heart and the right to be happy. It is a glimps into the lives of those who are forbiden to love each other. This is a heart warming story. This is a first book and it had a few flaws, but this writer will only get better and better as she goes forward. It was lovely and I am blessed that I read it."
19,"I really enjoyed the book. I believe the author did a good job at tackeling the subject of poor conduct in the church. I was reminded that we are all human, and even the mighty shall fall. Now I have to speak my mind regarding the poor reviews. I was shocked at the bahavior of ""adults"" What happened to respect for others. In my opinion I have to say those who wrote the mean reviews are nothing short of ignorent and without a doubt low class. Yes, there are minor errors in the book, but it did not change the greatness of the story for me. Who cares if a word on the back cover is missing an E? Did anyone stop to think that this book whent through a publisher most likely after it left the hands of Mrs, Haddon? I have to say, I am not one to leave reviews, but I just had too when I saw how this book was misrepresented. Not only was the author butchered, but those who liked the book as well were called illiterate. I agree with a fellow reviewer when I ask, how many of you have written a book? Obviously not many because you all have way too much time on your hands. I liked the book, and remember that those of you in glass houses should not throw stones."
20,"This was not a typical romance read. It is deep, loving and full of suspense. This book touches on wemon's issues and it caresses the heart. By the third chapter I was hooked. I did not think the first chapted was too long. It was great. I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who wants a great read."
21,"I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story."
22,"I loved this book for a few reasons. The first was that I felt as if I was not reading the story, but I was part of the story. I loved the way it twisted and turned at every corner, I loved that I simply did not know what to expect. The choice of words was spectacular and just when I thought that I was in control of my own emotions, something would jump up and surprise me. I am anxiously waiting for the next book, this was one of the best romance suspense books that I have read in years. I highly recomend it. I give this one five stars !!!!!!!!"
23,"I thought this book was brilliant. The plot was so good that it kept me guessing until the end. It worked its way into my heart and I can't help every now and then thinking about Maxwell, Heath and Julia. This is so great, I love this new writer and I can't wait for the next book. &lt;hint, hint> A must read for anyone with a beating heart."
24,"I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!"
25,"This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable."
26,"I was a dissapointed to see errors on the back cover, but since I paid for the book I read it anyway. I have to say I love it. I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in two hours. I say buy it. I say read it. It is sad, but it gives an interesting point of view on church today. We spend too much time looking at the faults of others. I also enjoyed beloved.Sincerly,Jaylynn R"
27,"A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
28,"I have to say that my friends at work all read this book and loved it. It was brought to our attention that there are negative reviews on this book that are false. For example the traveling librarian? We had a discussion about this book at work and the review of the traveling librarian is completely false. I pulled out the book and realized that these are lies and that someone is trying to ruin this book. The book never states that a garden is ten miles long. On page 62 it clearly states that the garden is five acres. No heartbeat of a fetus was heard at a week. How could it be? Julia was not even aware of the pregnancy at that time. The preacher never went to the house to give condolences, after reading the book once again it is obvious that he was there to fix the barn. So...on and ect... I also looked at the reviews &lt;history> all but one of the bad reviews is writen by someone who has never reviewed a book on amazon before. Veronica Haddon if you are reading this you need to write a letter to Amazon. Someon is playing a prank on you !!"
29,"I am an avid reader and I was shocked at how hooked I became on this book. I thought the first chapter was a little long and a little too discriptive, but truth be told after that I could not put this down. I read the other reviews on Whispers of the wicked saints before I wrote this and I saw one bad review that was written by someone who admitedly did not read this book. Don't take the advice of the ignorant, this book is an absolute must for romance fans. I give it five stars !!"
30,"This book was very discriptive and I actually found myself involved in the lives of the characters. If you ever get a chance to read this book, please do! I have found that the beginning of the book was a little too discriptive, but push through. The best is yet to come. You will definately find yourself wanting more. There was some parts in the book that made me HOT!! Veronica had a way with describing the places and the characters. I could actually see this story as if it were an actual movie. I really loved this book. If you are a romantic at heart and you love a great outcome, you must read Whispers of the Wicked Saints. GREAT, GREAT story!!"
31,"I happen to love romance novels, but only if they are goos romance. I am not one who loves everything, but this made my heart rejoice. I absolutlely could not put it down. Wow what a book !! You have to read this awesome story of forbiden love. I warn you now. It is steamy."
32,"This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night."
33,"This is a wonderful book that will keep you guessing. It is Rare to find a book that will make you laugh and cry at the same time and still leave you wondering what will happen next. What was even more amazing about it, is the fact that it is written in such a poetic way. This is a rare find and I look forward to the next book written by Veronica Haddon."
34,"Just as predicted the first chapter of the book was long. I continued reading and then fell in love with WOTWS. It is heart warming and realistic. I thought it was a little depressing, but I quickly realized the writers point. There is a rainbow at the end of each storm. I did notice the error on the cover, but it only made me love the writer more. This writer is talented and she is not corporate, nor does it appear that she has a staff working for her. Her book was writen from the heart and that is what makes an American literary legend. I would rather read a book with an error then to read hollow perfection any day of the week."
35,"I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle."
36,Normally I'm not much into romance stories but I absolutely loved this book. This book had the right kind of suspense that made it impossible to put down. Kept me wondering what would happen right up until the end. Loved it! I am looking for anything else this author puts out.
37,"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
38,"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
39,"I purchased this book after reading rave reviews of it included within a review of a really good book I'd read. Apparently, the author (or her friends and family) are placing reviews of good books and encouraging people to buy this book if you liked the one they were reviewing. Great marketing by the author. However, the author should probably stick to marketing and give up the idea of being a writer. This book could have been written by a middle-schooler. It is a self-published, self-edited (and extremely poorly edited, I might add), and self-promoted lame excuse for a novel. My eyes rolled constantly while reading this book. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse...it did. The best part of this book is the short length. There is no substance, no character development, and the plot (if there actually is one) is pathetic. I generally trust the reviewers on Amazon. I really feel duped for purchasing this book after reading about it in Amazon's readers' reviews. Don't waste your money. The author should have printed only enough copies for family and friends. The rest of the population should be spared having to read this drivel."
40,"It has been years since I've read a romance novel. If this is typical of the genre these days, I will never pick up another one. Not only is the plot contrived and juvenile, the writing shows the lack of skill expected only in a child's writing. Many of my seventh grade writing students would be embarrassed if this trash was attributed to them. ""The bed squeaked slightly, but her husband was unmoved by the sharp squeaks from the bed as well as the howling noises caused by the wind that were surrounding him."" Were the squeaks slight or sharp, and were she and her husband sleeping outside that the wind could be howling around him not the house? This is just one mangled sentence in a book filled with such tripe. If my criticism seems harsh, it's because I actually paid money for this book. What a waste!I would suggest that Miss Haddon go back to Junior High School and begin a serious course of writing instruction. Perhaps by the time she graduates from college she will have gained an understanding of good sentence construction, proper punctuation, and the value of using adjectives sparingly. And if she reads a great deal along the way, she might also learn how to construct a plausible plot."
41,"It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?"
42,"I really enjoyed this book, sure this author is just starting out, but I still really liked it. How many books have the reviewers that hated this book wrote and got published? I read a lot, and I always have. I don't usually like modern love stories, but I gave it a chance and found that I didn't want to put it down until I finished it. I look forward to reading her next book and no I'm not a family member or a friend. Just give her book a chance and you might just find that it really is pretty good."
43,"I loved this little book, I thought the first chapter was a little long, but even though it was long I loved it. This writer is a 3D writer. Her words make you feel as if you are the character and I loved that. This is a first novel for Veronica, and I am forever a fan !!"
44,I can not talk this book up enough. It was well writen and a major page turner. It was a book about a pastor that falls for a member of his congregation. It will leave your heart full and your mind pondering question of infidelity and what is right and wrong and where God draws the line. It is a must read.
45,"I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through, wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough, it got worse. If the writing is bad, the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no, all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind, she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though, conveniently, he's dying too, and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and, oh joy, she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly, a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry, she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead, leaving the coast free for the ""wicked saints"" of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on ""other reviews"" to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books, made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned!"
46,"from publisher:Addresses the interplay of diverse spiritual, religious, and cultural traditions across the Caribbean.Dealing with the ongoing interaction of rich and diverse cultural traditions from Cuba and Jamaica to Guyana and Surinam, Nation Dance addresses some of the major contemporary issues in the study of Caribbean religion and identity. The book's three sections move from a focus on spirituality and healing, to theology in social and political context, and on to questions of identity and diaspora.The book begins with the voices of female practitioners and then offers a broad, interdisciplinary examination of Caribbean religion and culture. Afro-Caribbean religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity are all addressed, with specific reflections on Santer&iacute;a, Palo Monte, Vodou, Winti, Obeah, Kali Mai, Orisha work, Spiritual Baptist faith, Spiritualism, Rastafari, Confucianism, Congregationalism, Pentecostalism, Catholicism, and liberation theology. Some essays are based on fieldwork, archival research, and textual or linguistic analysis, while others are concerned with methodological or theoretical issues. Contributors include practitioners and scholars, some very established in the field, others with fresh, new approaches; all of them come from the region or have done extensive fieldwork or research there. In these essays the poetic vitality of the practitioner's voice meets the attentive commitment of the postcolonial scholar in a dance of ""nations"" across the waters."
47,"With the publication of Everett Ferguson's book on ecclesiology, another milestone has been reached in the scholarly presentation of the distinctive theological perspective of Churches of Christ. The book is divided into six chapters, each roughly sixty to seventy pages in length. Within each chapter, Ferguson neatly and systematically outlines his thoughts and arguments. The first chapter, entitled ""The People and the Messiah: History and Eschatology,"" deals mainly with background issues. It examines the Old Testament teaching on the importance of covenant and the meaning of the phrase ""kingdom of God"" in its relationship to an and distinction from the church. Ferguson enters into the New Testament and ecclesiology proper via a consideration of Jesus as Messiah, including a careful exegesis of Matt. 16:13-23, where he concludes that the ""rock"" of Matt. 16:18 is not Peter, but the fact of Jesus' Messiahship. Ferguson's analysis of Matt. 16:13-23 is insightful and carefully articulated. Within this section, he gives attention to ""the gates of Hades will not prevail"" and concludes with some interesting yet encouraging insight. In the second chapter, ""The Church and Her Lord: The Nature of the Church,"" Ferguson deals with and focuses on three images, ""people of God,"" ""body of Christ,"" and ""community of the Spirit."" A peculiar feature in this chapter is placing the discussion of the word ekklesia last rather than first. The latter would seem more appropriate and would seem to set the stage for the chapter, especially for a work of biblical ecclesiology. This great section will open the eyes of the reader and renew his focus of church. That is to say, this chapter correctly puts Christ as the head of the church and gives Him His appropriate place. The third chapter concentrates on, ""The Church and Her Savior: Salvation and Church Membership."" Essentially this section covers soteriology, which determines ecclesiology, but it is not ecclesiology itself. His full treatment of the nature of sin, the meaning of the cross, and the human response to God's saving work is only loosely linked to his topic of ecclesiology. This is not to say that this section is uninteresting or uninformative because it is quite helpful for a fuller understanding of these matters. Far more important is the content of Ferguson's soteriology. Ferguson is strong when it comes to the necessity of baptism. A few statements will give the reader an idea of his position: ""Baptism is the time at which one is incorporated into Christ and so becomes a child of God"" (pg. 170); ""Baptism is a `calling on the name' of the Lord"" (pg. 180); and, ""Baptism is the appointed time at which God pronounces forgiveness"" (pg. 183). He concludes: There must be an objective necessity about baptism, or New Testament writers could not speak of baptism in the way they do"" (pg. 185). How refreshing! In our world of relativity and ecumenism, people need to hear Ferguson's words, especially those in Churches of Christ. The last three chapters move into a more familiar territory for a treatise on the church. Chapter four, ""The Church and Her High Priest: Worship and Assembly"" is a great section for anyone interested in the dynamics of worship. Here, Ferguson begins with a type of etymology as a way of introduction, concentrating on both the Greek and English words. This introduction to the subject sets the stage for the entire chapter. Worship is a hot topic today, thus chapter four is rather applicable for our day with all the differing views. This section is multitudinously faceted and exhaustive. ""The Church and Her Bishop: The Continuing Ministry"" is appropriately the title for the fifth chapter. In this section, Ferguson again touches on some hot topics in the church. It is unfortunate however that he only briefly deals with the debates on miraculous gifts and women's roles. Ferguson advocates a cessasionist position on miraculous gifts and a complementarian position on women's roles, but leaves the reader thirsting for more information and a more comprehensive treatment of the issues. In a day where these two in particular issues are so widely discussed and debated, one would think that they might have received a little concentration. Again, this is not to eradicate what was accomplished in this chapter because it was insightful and obliging, especially given the fact that his discussion on deaconesses was amazingly insightful and well balanced. In chapter six Ferguson adequately covers, ""The Church and Her Teacher: The New Way of Life."" In this section, he includes an unusually prominent consideration of ethics and a very healthy discussion of the importance of Christian fellowship and its concomitant, church discipline. One last thing that must be mentioned about this chapter is Ferguson's section on unity. Although this section is brief, it is significant and insightful. Ferguson lays out the various aspects of unity and does so in just a few short pages. It serves as an excellent conclusion to a monumental work. Of course, any reader is free to take issue with some of Ferguson's conclusions. For example, the distinction that is made between the temporary and permanent endowments of the Spirit still awaits additional clarification, and there will be those who will score Ferguson, despite his disclaimer, for his synchronic rather than diachronic approach to the New Testament writings. This is a courageous book. Its Reformed-Restorationist slant that the proper doctrine of the church entails a return to the faith and practice of the apostolic church is unmistakable. There are numerous nuggets of exegesis and important points of emphases that make this book worth reading. It is astounding that Ferguson deals with so many facets of ecclesiology in a one-volume work. Not only that, but he also includes a helpful subject index as well as a number of bibliographies. Just a glance at his copious footnotes and it is clear that this book is well researched and well documented. This book should be one that every minister, church leader, and ministry student is required to read and ponder."
48,Everett Ferguson approaches the subject of early christian development with quotes from their early documents in their own words. Ferguson gives us a peek into the minds of early Christians and puts it together in a form one can understand today. The only criticism is that he can get too technical and detailed at times. With patience his writing is able to be followed by a serious student of the subject of God's church. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of the subject!
49,This book is a continual resource. It is so biblical and so simple. Dr. Ferguson's candid honesty is transparent to the bright shining light of Christ's words for His glorious Church.
50,This is a very useful and thorough text book. I would recommend it for anyone who wants an in depth study of the Lord's church.
51,Full of intrigue and a good overview of the court of James 1 and the key players. Provides a good general history of all the facts of the case.
52,"This play was excellent. It's very smart, intellectually and morally meaty, and fast. I highly recommend it. Especially good material to ponder for people who in today's age can still think of the US or any country as being moral and right and good."
53,"This is a fast read filled with unexpected humour and profound insights into the art of politics and policy. In brief, it is sly, wry, and wise."
54,This is an old play I saw on stage many years ago. It still brings a laugh at times. But also a reality check at other times. Truly a great play. Glad it's still available.
55,"Tells the wonderful story of how St. Hyacinth and his fellow Dominicans planted the Holy Catholic Faith in Poland, Lithuania, Russia, and all over Northern Europe. Many were the remarkable events in this Saint's life, including the raising of the dead! For children ages 10 and up. 17 illustrations. 189pp. PB. Imprimatur."
56,"Who was Saint Hyacinth? The story starts with a chance meeting in Rome where he witnesses (the future) Saint Dominic raising a man from death. From that point the book is one miracle and amazing encounter on Hyacinth's journey across North Europe. He raised the dead, walks on water, fled the invading Tatars from a Cathedral carrying a 500 lb. Statue. All thoughout he dispenses his own brand of spiruatilty and humility. The book reads liks a combination of a self help book like the One minute Manager and the excitement of the Raiders of the Lost Arc. Kids will love this book to be read to them. They will never forget Saint Hyacinth. I know I never will."
57,"Steven Wardell's book is a pure delight and I've recommended itto friends of all ages. In Rising Sons and Daughters, we learn thatJapanese young people are preserving their country's tradition of respect for their elders while also creating their own identity as Japan's &quot;Generation X&quot;. Like our own young people, they are bombarded with some of the excesses of &quot;Western culture&quot; - Clothing fads, rock groups, a culture of shopping, etc. What they seem to be developing, however, is a healthy hybrid of old and new that retains a firm foundation in good values. The Ando family members are wonderful, memorable people and Stevern Wardell writes poignantly about their lives and hopes of each of them."
58,"I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the &quot;New Young&quot; of Japan seem to be creating an &quot;international&quot; blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"
59,"Steven Wardell went to Japan without reading any of the hundreds of books about Japan. He went without any idea of how Japan would treat him. So what he writes seems to come to us without much editing by any pre-made belief. No filters are between us and the experiences he had day to day. All the details about school, family life and learning the language comes to us without any forethought.Compared to other books on Japan this is raw, unmolded, information and is full of insight that I doubt even Wardell realized was amazing for such a young writer. I would say that this is a must for anybody planning on going to Japan for ANY reason.Did find some humor in the fact that Wardell felt the need to explain everything, even what a corn dog was, and that when he met other exchange students one complained about how the Japanese, and I quote, Couldn't even speak English good, end of quote. Couldn't even speak English GOOD? Neither can the exchange students it seems.All in all, you need to get it. Used, paperback, in hardcover, any version you can. Just get it."
60,"This is an excellent book. It offers the opinions of a diverse sample of real Muslim Women with very different attitudes. It will not appeal to those who don't want to listen or who want an anti-islamic feminist political tract. The value of this is that you hear the opinions, educated and not, of the real people involved.Most of the time, the real voices are ignored and what is presented in the name of feminism is non-muslim american female TV personalities yacking endlessly on about the lives and experiences of people they really don't know and don't want to know.What must be understood above all else is that if you wish to change a society or a culture, you must at the very least understand how the people in that culture who disagree with you think. That is what this book does so well. I may not agree at all with the opinion of every woman in the book, but I at least understand how they think after finishing it.What many will never understand is that Islamic Society has changed and is still changing. But it can only change by consensus from within. No amount of cultural imperialism from western countries is going to change anything for the better.There is also more than a little hypocracy. For all the lectures about the veil from American Women, few of them stop to think about why they are themselves forced into certain choices. A veil isn't great, but its a whole lot more confortable than the pantyhose that many Western women must wear effectively as a condition of employment. One wonders at a certain point if its the veil itself they object to or that as constrasted to their money-driven appearance decisons, the veil has a meaning beyond the secular."
61,"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
62,"Although written with script authors et al in mind, Dramatica for Screenwriters is the perfect companion book for Dramatica: A New Theory of Story.Using witty and easy to understand examples, the author takes you systematically through the process of turning a meager idea into a full-blown, grand argument story via Dramatica Theory definitions. With a slight mental adjustment, the tips and advice in this book fit the novelist's dilemma as well as the screenwriter's. If you are exploring the world of Dramatica, you need this book on your shelf."
63,"Sorry for any mistake I could do here, English is not my first language.While Dramatica is a powerful tool for building a story, it is complex and sometimes overwhelming. Armando Salda&ntilde;a-Mora found a way to demystify Dramatica and give a lot of practical advices and principles for creating a story with Dramatica.""Dramatica for Screenwriters"" is easy to understand, fun and thought-provoking. The only drawback is that this book is not useful if you do not know the Dramatica Theory or do not use Dramatica software. Now, if you're a Dramatica user or if you plan to seriously evaluate the software, it is a must-have."
64,"I purchased this book based on the other reviews claiming that it ""demystifies"" the Dramatica theory and software. Unfortunately, I found the opposite to be the case.I've made numerous attempts to get my head around the principles of the Dramatica theory, with the intention of finally being able to put to use the rather pricey Dramatica Pro software I bought years ago. Both the software itself, and the book of theory explaining it (""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"") are so riddled with specialized (and somewhat proprietary) jargon that I've long counted myself among the number of users for whom the effort to grasp the principles involved outweighed the potential benefits. (And BTW, I'm no newcomer to the basic premises of story structure; I've got an MFA from a respectable film school, and have worked for many years as a film editor.)I'd had high hopes for ""Dramatica For Screenwriters"", figuring it would serve as a practical layman's guide to understanding and using the software. Unfortunately (there's that word again), despite claims in the author's introduction to the contrary, a few pages in the jargon begins coming at the reader hot and heavy, and unlike in ""Dramatica: A New Theory of Story"", which I already found to be too opaque, here much of the jargon is not even explained in a cursory manner. Reader familiarity is assumed, which would seem to defeat the purpose of the book in the first place. So the reader is left with a bit of a Catch-22: if you need the book, you probably won't understand it, and if you can understand the book, you probably don't need it."
65,"Dramatica is a pain in the ass to learn. The main book is dense, repetitive, dilatory and slow. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS is the opposite! The writing flows easily. It's directs you to the easiest possible paths for getting started. It encourages you to take action and walks you through it. It provides good theoretical guidance without getting bogged down.This is the book that should come with the software for everyone, not just screenwriters. It gives anyone who reads it the ability to jump into A STORY and get it done. Once you've gotten A STORY done you can use Dramatica to alter it for it's media (you may need the main book to get you there). You can also get more stories done with it. Dramatica is not intuitive software. You need to use it from a number of angles to get the hang of it. DRAMATICA FOR SCREENWRITERS gets you there. The main Dramatica book doesn't. READ THIS BOOK FIRST."
66,"I think the hardest thing for people coming to Dramatica the first time is understanding that the theory and software are not designed to write your story for you (or tell you what your story is about), but rather to tell you, based on the way you answer all the hundreds of questions, what the best storyform or context is from which to tell your story in the way you want.[...]I did the work to know the theory, but ""Dramatica for Screenwriters"" really helped me understand it. Even though I am a fiction writer and not a screenwriter, I found that most of this book applies to any kind of fictional world building. I highly recommend it.Don't buy the book thinking it's going to take the place of doing the work of getting to know the theory. It assumes prior knowledge."
67,"Beauty is in the bones. This book gives your story good bones, and you end up knowing why. It is a clear explanation of how to do the structure of a story so the end product is a top model. You have to supply the writing, a big commitment, but you won't have the feeling when you're done that something is incomplete or wrong - and all your work goes to something which misses the mark.We have all seen too many movies where the verdict is ""Interesting!"" To a writer, this is deadly. It means that all the work of director and actors and film crew, editors and producers, went for naught because the starting place, the script, had the final flaws buried in its pages. Use this book and your story will have a coherence and an internal logic that will be solid and subtle - and when you put on it the forensic anthopologist's 'layer of flesh,' what will stare back at you will be a thing of beauty."
68,A really good book to go with the software an excellent guide I highly recommend . . . . .
69,"This is the way to get a handle on the incredibly complex yet useful theory of Dramatica and its program. At one time I almost went crazy trying to figure out how to use it with my writing and finally gave up, until I found this book. Armando is a genius."
70,I am finding out that my 10 years old copy of Dramatica may be worth Something. I know about Armando from early adopters and listserve participants. I have poured over many times my dogeared notes of Instant dramatica before....Then I got distracted but knew this book was coming...That was 2005...but I am starting with this book now.I am at just part 3 of the book now and I am already feeling like a skilled storyteller.Thanks to Armando for sharing invaluable wealth of PRO information getting me back on the road....And restoring my belief in usefulness of Dramatica.....
71,"It's just awesome, even better than what you can read online about using dramatica of Armando. If you want to use Dramatica - and don't want to get lost eventually - you really, really, really need this guide to get to some point you can call your plot really a plot. This book just makes you very, very happy. For it will boost your efforts to really WORK with dramatica. I only wish we had had that book ten years before. So I do highly recommend it. Even if you aren't a native speaker like me, having german as my mother tongue. I would never have made it with the DRAMATICA SOFTWARE if I haven't had this book. Believe me. It's worth every Cent (I payed in Euro). Though I tried very hard for roundabout 2 years I was coming to fail with Dramatica 4.0. This book saved my ass. Let it save yours too. It's making me happy. Thank you so much, Armando. Greetings from Germany, Cologne"
72,"Not much I can say about this book... It's full of VVVery difficult number puzzles... at least for me. Okay, so I don't get 'A's for my grades at school, but I think that even you might find it a little difficult. The way I see it, you will need lots of paper, patience and time, say 30 minutes or so to solve even the easiest of these.Why? Because basically, you are asked how many combinations can be formed from such and such. Example: How many ways get 31241 by adding prime numbers only? This is not really what the problems are like in the book, they are far more complicated than that.For me, it's just too much. I can't even do 1 single problem. I can't even look up the answers because uses some sort of a legend that I can't understand. But if you have an above average intelligence or are mathematically gifted, you will probably find some obscure short cut to the problem a la Gauss. For the rest, forget it.Word of warning: these are purely number problems. I can't tell if logic will help or even plays a part in this book, but the problems are NUMBER problems."
73,"This is a good book if you like numbers puzzles.It contains different types of puzzles such asgrids, sequences, logic and many others.They can be difficult at times; with a littlepatience, they can be solved."
74,"An essential book for researchers and engineers working on vector quantization. It provides a (nearly) exhaustive description of the available VQ methods, with analyses and discussions. The book concentrates on VQ, so don't buy it if you're not interested in that only. Most math tools explained. Could be a little bit outdated on some aspects -&gt; things are moving fast in the field."
75,"Many useful concepts of digital compression can be found in this book. It is easy to read and understand, especially for students and engineers in EE."
76,"This book appears to be a ""print on demand"" style book which manifests itself, in this case, as a poor quality hardcover. Some of the text is laughably bad, the few images near the end look like they are snapshots from a black and white TV screen, but most bothersome is the ""muddy"" look of the text. The price seems a bit steep for such a poor quality print. That said, the actual content is very comprehensive. One of the authors (Gray) is co-creator of the now commonplace LBG (Linde Buzo Gray) VQ algorithm. Fortunately, the quality of the content shines through the terrible printing."
77,"It seems somebody was complaining for the printing quality. This is not a calculus book. If you take most theoretical books, and certainly most Springer's book, they don't have nice full color Barney images. This is technical (mostly theoretical) stuff. There is, in my opinion, no problem with the printing at all, clear, quality monochromatic printing.With respect to the contents of the book, it has almost everything you may want to know about Vector (and even Scalar) quantization and Signal compression. It was a great help while I was writing my doctoral thesis. Gray is probably one of the most respected authorities in the field."
78,"It seems that authors have pictures unrelated to content of the text repeatedly printed. It does not cover major topics, such as .gif/ graphic file compression. On the positive side it is well-written, organized, multiple equation in some chapters, descriptive in others. Very little mathematical proof."
79,"Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. ""Dr Shen Fu"", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous."
80,A great New Zealand book writen in the true Barry Crump way
81,"If you are someone who is fairly new to the law school admissions process and haven't done much research on what it takes to get into law school, this information might seem very helpful and insightful to you. However, as someone who has read several other books (Richard Montauk's &quot;How To Get Into the Top Law Schools,&quot; Robert Miller's &quot;Law School Confidential&quot; and more) and done the necessary research on the internet, this book brought very little new information to the table. Perhaps the most unique thing about this book is the &quot;15 essential factors&quot;...unfortunately, many of those 15 factors--though essential--are things the average person applying to law school--particularly top law schools--doesn't care about and might cast aside even after reading this book.I do agree with her that many pre-law advisers are ill-prepared to advise pre-law students and don't know nearly as much as they should. However, if the info in this book is the information she provided other pre-law advisers with, then it's nothing that the advisers nor the students couldn't have come up with themselves or elsewhere. I still say Montauk's book is the best on law school admissions out there, regardless of what schools you're interested in. HIS book is the one with all the insider secrets in it. Wright's book is just a very broad overview of the admissions process, in my opinion.The one thing this book totally has in common with Montauk's book that is very disappointing is that they do nothing to help minorities know what the admissons process will truly be like for them or how to handle it. For that, you have to look up books by Evangeline Mitchell. Most books have a tendency to treat everyone the same, as if all the information applies to them the same, and that is deceiving.In conclusion, if you feel pretty well-informed already about admissions or are looking for an extra bit of information that might give you that edge or illuminate your particular situation...this book is not the one for you. Only if you really know very little about law school admissions might this book be worth it...but I'd still say it'd be best to go with Montauk's eye-opening admissions guide."
82,"Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you."
83,"My advisor never asked any of the right questions or gave me the kind of information that would have helped me with my plan to study law. While looking for books on the LSAT I found this book and it really helped. It told me everything that the best advisor would have told me. It really helped me evaluate how I felt about law school and how to properly prepare myself. The last time I went back to my advisor he was shocked at how much I knew. I feel really good about my applications and think I have a really good chance of getting a ""big envelope""."
84,"This book answered all my questions about getting into law school in a plain and straightforward way. It was easy to read, and clear in its explanations. It even answered many questions I hadn't even thought to ask. The stories that are included in its &quot;Tales From the Trenches&quot; are really interesting, sometimes funny, and really help you to know how to avoid mistakes you might otherwise make. It's much more help than any other source I have found. The only thing it doesn't do is have a full LSAT prep course, but it does give you examples of the questions, and tells you how you can structure your own preparation program. Buying this book actually saved me money by helping me choose only to the right law schools for me, and by giving me a way to evaluate LSAT courses.(It turns out that a lot of expensive courses are not as good as you might think!) The appendix alone is worth the cost of the book. It has information on all the law schools sorted by the &quot;15 Essential Factors&quot; for picking law schools as they are outlined in the book. It makes it easier to sort through all the schools to find the right ones to apply to. This book really gave me confidence that I will get into law school. I can't wait to get my &quot;big envelopes&quot;!"
85,What can I say? It works. This helped me when applying to law schools. A great guide to utilize. Cutting a great score on the LSAT is just part of the equation to get into law school.
86,"Boy am I lucky to have found The Ultimate Guide to Law School Admission. I picked it up because a friend recommended it to me as being the best book for the law school application process, and was she right! When I got the book I skipped right to the chapters on the admission process and found the whole thing very informative and encouraging. It let me know that even though I'm not the best student, there are plenty of schools that I would definitly get in to, and it told me how to make my application the best it could possibly be. I am sure that I would have gotten into at least a couple of the schools I had picked to apply to. However, lucky for me, before I sent in my applications I decided to read the book again. This time I started with the first chapter &quot;Should I go to law school.&quot; Guess what? Being a lawyer isn't what I thought it was! I mean, this book told me things about what lawyers personal lives are like, and what their average work day is like... stuff that I had never gotten anywhere else! This chapter convinced me that I would not be happy being a lawyer! Not only did this chapter save me from the expensive application fees... it saved me from spending the next three years wasting my time, and tuition money, pursuing a degree that would have put me in a job that apparently isn't right for me at all! Thank you Mrs. Wright, you saved me $100,000.00! I definitly recommend that EVERYONE read this chapter first! Don't go to law school without it!!!"
87,"If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
88,"Using a quiet, restrained writing style that is a pure pleasure to read, Gurstein chronicles the one-sided battle between the party of exposure and the party of reticence. She is on the side of reticence and writes with the pained nostalgia of a Southerner describing aspects of the War Between the States. Guerstein knows that reticence is a lost cause; she asks only whether it should be.Gurstein makes a quiet case for the reintroduction of taste, judgement, and sensibility into our public lives. This is a common theme these days. What is uncommon is that she derives her &quot;argument&quot; (always presented with the greatest of civility) from the distortion of privacy that somehow led from Brandeis's great legal work on privacy to the transformation of social man to private men and women and eventually to the public dissemination of all sorts of private matters. This is innovative and intriguing.Reticence should emerge from the coordinated behavior of civilized persons; it should not be coerced by legislation and litigation. It is thus especially appropriate that Gurstein never hectors or lectures. Instead, she paints such a delightful alternative portrait of life, far from morning talk radio, nightly real tv, and ever-present commercial messages in nearly all media, that she inspires the reader to aspire toward at least some aspects of reticence.I felt that Gurstein did not define reticence early enough and failed to take advantage of the opportunities to add more detail as the book progressed. I assume that the party of reticence acquired useful knowledge over time, such as after its (happily) failed efforts to prosecute the publisher of Joyce's Ulysses. But these reservations are minor.My most serious concern is whether the domestic party of reticence has foreign (and sometimes not-so-foreign) counterparts in governments that have successfully enforced taste through stern rule of law. I would have appreciated a treatment of these cultural (or anti-cultural) forces. Althoug! h very difficult, such an effort would have greatly sharpened my understanding of the tenets of the party of reticence and its role in our society. Gurstein surely knows that the mere existence of such potential counterparts to her domestic party of reticence may chill further inquiry; after all, she records numerous instances in which the party of exposure has dangled straw men for talismanic protection from true debate. It would be very useful if Gurstein, accounting for the human rights of those oppressed by governmental regimes, could make a better case for the human rights of those increasingly oppressed by the party of exposure, whose methodology of oppression is vastly different. The incremental personal losses to the party of exposure do not lend themselves to the same degree of drama, but possibly, over a sufficiently long period of time, they can present, cumulatively, a meaningful loss of freedom.Henry James wrote that the words, &quot;summer afternoon&quot; were the most pleasant in the English language. Take a summer afternoon (or two) to read this euphonious essay for a refreshing breather from the cacophony of Howard Stern, Don Imus, and their local knock-offs; follow-up news stories on Viagra; Judge Judy; infomercials; network news; and the culture of money, sex, power, and fame hustled by the print and electronic media."
89,"Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
90,"Books by Dr Kenneth Cooper have been a tremendous source of guidance for me for over 30 years.When I first started being affected by the stress side effects of working too hard and too long in the 70's I started exercising. At the time jogging/running was becoming quite popular, so I took that up. I like to read so I read the Jim Fixx book on running which led me to Dr Cooper's book ""Aerobics"" (a term he coined), then to ""Aerobics Program for total Well Being..."", which became sort of a bible for a long time. After retirement I quit smoking and started going to a doctor. Found to be out of shape - again - I looked up Dr Cooper and saw his book ""Start Strong, Finish Strong"" which I absorbed like a sponge dropped in a bucket of water. Joined a gym and started the prescription of 55% aerobics, 45% strength and have never felt better. Now I've got one doctor trying to tie me down to hypertension drugs. That diagnosis was contrary to my own readings, so I'm in the middle of a complete cardio workup. (The initial stress test results were great, waiting for the in depth analysis.) When I saw this book it was a gotta have.In this book Dr. Cooper very thoughtfully presents all factors in a very helpful manner with a goal of controlling blood pressure without medications, but points out factors that could make them necessary. After my first reading I feel like I can more intelligently discuss the stress test results with my cardiologist, then better deal with my general physician.I would hardily, strongly recommend this book for any person who has had a too high blood pressure reading."
91,"Ruth Allman has written an excellent book about Alaskan sourdough history and provided very tasty receipes. As a resident of Kodiak,Alaska I have been lucky enough to get some of Ruth Allmans sourdough starter. I have tried her receipes and all I can say is , wow! San Francisco look out. You get a real sense of the struggle of the pioneers with this book, and the way she describs the receipes, you can just imagine spreading the butter and jam on the bread. My favorite receipe is the hot griddle cakes with fresh strawberries. As Ruth says, the art of mixing the batter with air, and the timing of slopping it on the grill is a skill learned over time. The Baked Alaska with sourdough waffles (which by the way is how it was actually first made) is a dessert from heaven. This is a book that every sourdough making Alaskan owns."
92,"I have been using this book since 1988, the eighth printing, and I can honestly say it is the best sourdough cookbook I have seen. The recipe's are easy to follow and the history lessons are entertaining as well. Ms. Allman has written a really fun book and I do mean written. The entire book is hand written ! Truly an Alaskan cookbook."
93,"My poor dogeared, stained copy of this book came to me by way of my dad and brother after their trip to Alaska in 1989. Dad acquired some starter in about 1959 that its guardian said had been going since the days of the 49ers. I know it's been bubbling since then. All Dad made, though, were bread and rubbery pancakes. He, unfortunately, didn't buy a copy for himself, although I'd give anything to have him make another meal of them! You see, that's the magic of sourdough, the romance, the stories, the memories! I've not yet been to Alaska, but Ruth Allman has taken me from Cheechako to Sourdough by generously sharing her recipes and her stories with me. I read this book just for the enjoyment of it sometimes. We had her waffles this morning. I made her Flower Rolls recipe into Danish rolls for my famously fussy father-in-law. What better tribute could I make to this cook and her book than to say that he loved them! My two year old son and I will make a little fire in the woods and bake a sourdough version of bannock in Dad's old Dutch oven this week and make some memories of our own."
94,"I found a copy of this cookbook at a local used book store and mixed up a sourdough starter the following day. It was bubbling away the next morning and I can't wait to try it in a few more days...The directions in this book are simple to follow. The anecdotes and history provided are entertaining. The recipes all sound delicious! I'll be working my way through many of these, starting of course with the sourdough hotcakes and bread. The handwritten format just adds to the charm of the book. If you're interested in learning to make sourdoughs, this book will give you all the information you'll need."
95,"As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must."
96,"For those of us who would prefer to use sourdough starter as the sole leavening agent in making breads, this cookbook is very helpful in getting us ""started"". There are some receipts calling for the addition of yeast, and baking soda is often added not so much to leaven loaves as to create a chemical change which dampens some of the sourness in a very sour pot of starter. Overall, this book gives some of the best history of sourdough from a lady who knows first-hand the importance of an active sourdough starter, and will get any beginner started off making some very good breads, rolls, breakfast items & desserts. There is even a section at the end for making various products from the wild berries grown in the Last Frontier (for those of us who are able to utilize lingonberries & such)! Even for those who don't care to do a lot of baking, this book has a great deal of interesting information about Alaska & its pioneers - a great read for celebrating our 50th year of Statehood!"
97,"Make the most sublime waffles - crispy outside, creamy inside, and with a flavor that beats anything else. So good that my children want them even as plain unheated leftovers later in the morning."
98,"I got this book because of all the interesting stories and sourdough tidbits that it contained. The stories were informative, a fascinating look at history, and most of all - FUN! Then, because she made it sound so easy and delectable - I decided to try making sourdough and see what would happen. I had to go back and forth in the book a little to make sure I was doing everything correctly - the Sourdough Hints in the back were very helpful. Well, it's been a week since I mixed up the starter. The sourdough smelled ""sour cream sour"" and it looked OK. (I was glad not to see little black fungus or other such nasties growing on the surface like the last sourdough I tried to make 20 years ago). So I made the Quick Sourdough Bread today. I figured that was a good place to start since I didn't want to take time for the 2 risings that the regular Sourdough Bread recipe called for. It rose nicely in the pan. It smelled good. But I did take it out of the oven 10 minutes early, because it was a deep golden brown and I was afraid it would be a rock-hard loaf if I waited the full 45 minutes. I brushed butter on the crust to soften it a little (still paranoid about the possible hard crust) and waited for it to cool. I sliced it. My husband and I had one slice. Then we had another. (And, yes, then we had one more with black cherry jam!) Oh My Goodness!! I haven't had bread that tasted that good in a LONG time!! My husband put it this way, ""It is a slice of Heaven!"". I agreed wholeheartedly - better than candy, cake or cookies! So take it from a person who has hundreds of cook books and probably thousands of recipes and has cooked all sorts of bread for the last 30+ years - this book is worth getting. It made the best bread we have ever eaten and now I can't wait to try some of the other recipes in the book. Four thumbs up."
99,"It's quaint, I'll give it that. The handwritten style and illustrations are reminiscent of, perhaps, an early scratch draft of ""The Moosewood"" done with a sharpie instead of a nib and ink. But the recipes for bread are poorly assembled.Any bread maker knows how the proportionality of ingredients is key for bread. I've tried two of the four bread recipes so far and neither have performed well. One recipe calls for 8 to 10 cups of flour, which I halved, and so attempted 4 to 5 cups. At 3 cups, my dough was full. Okay, yes, great variety of atmospheres and starter consistency, yes, but the next recipe was like that too. And my sponge has not raised a mm in 24 hours. Perhaps it's too cold in my kitchen? Nevertheless, don't expect this book to even hint at how long a rise will take.And what kind of sourdough calls for baking soda or commercial yeast? The kinds in this book!I'm not claiming to be an expert on bread, but I've made two loaves a week for 2 years now, with a lot of success with other cookbooks (America's Bread Book, The Bread Book, My Bread); I think this one is lame. I'm glad it's my housemate's and that I didn't pay for it."
100,"Bought this in 1982 and used it thoroughly for years until it fell apart and was held together with rubber bands, paper clips, and clothes pins...then it got away. This book is as much fun just to read as it is to cook from. Full of Alaskan lore, great recipes, and if you are into sourdough, or think you might be, this may be the only recipe book you'll ever need for just plain family eating: breads, biscuits, hot cakes, waffles, and anecdotes."
101,"I toured the House of Wickersham in Juneau Alaska years ago. After the tour, Ruth Allman served everyone Sourdough pancakes with her Rose Hip syrup. After such a delicious treat, I bought a copy of her book. I have a 1976 first edition. It has had a lot of use and that use is showing. In a few years, I will have to get another, later edition of this book.It is the best sourdough cooking book I have, and the stories she tells of ""Life on the Last Frontier"" only add to the book. Her father, Judge Wickersham, was one of the first territorial judges and first territorial governors of Alaska, having served in these positions shortly after President Lincoln purchased Alaska from Russia. Ruth weaves stories her father told her, throughout her book. Ruth and her husband Jack Allman, lived many years as Alaska Pioneers, and had to survive on their sourdough pot. From those days comes many of Ruth's receipes.My only regret is that I did not have Ruth Allman autograph my copy."
102,"This is a wonderful book. Now I have so many more ways to use from my ""Sourdough Pot""...My Sourdough has been bubbling for a long time, but I was limited on recipes. This is also just a fun book to read."
103,"I had an excellent sourdough starter from a friend in Alaska. Debbie lived on the 49 Mile River. During the winter they, Debbie & Brad made bent wood furinture to sell in a general store in Dawson. Then pan for gold in the summer. Sourdough bread & hot cakes was a staple of life for them living in such a remote location.Ruth Allman's, ""Alaska Sourdough"" cook book is an excellent primer in making a sourdough ""starter"" from scratch,(just in case you can't get a start from a friend) the proper care for your starter, and how to rejuveniate the starter when needed. We are very selective who we share our sourdough bread & rolls with. We don't want to be depended upon to provide bakery items all the time.We made our purchase from redtree15 on Amazon Marketplace. We really appreciate the service provided."
104,REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes.
105,"After having a chance to read through the book I am not sure I would have bothered purchasing it in a store. The ""sourdough lore"" is very interesting but in order to make the book seem more ""authentically old"" the author has hand-written each and every page. That's right, the only thing typed in this book is the copyright info. Her handwriting is more or less legible but it's much more difficult to read at a glance and the frequent misspellings bother me. The instructions also assume that you already know how to do a lot of things. For example, on the recipe for doughnuts it says to mix the ingredients, allow to rise, and the deep fry the cut doughnuts. I have to cut doughnuts? Is there anything I do to them first? I don't know, because none of that is included in the recipe. Also, there is no master index.Finally, all the recipes I have gone through are scaled to make massive portions. There is no eating for two out of this cookbook and you can't cut them down because they call for an odd number of eggs. Example - the pancake recipe will make about 15-20 medium sized pancakes (and calls for two cups of sourdough starter - not workable for people who don't have huge batches of starter) yet calls for only 1 egg.UPDATE: After working with this cookbook more, I wish I could have given it a lower review. It's not really a cookbook as there are probably only about 5 unique recipes. Everything else is a VARIATION that she calls a new recipe. And some of her suggestions are just plain gross. Corned beef and Worcestershire pancakes? Cottage cheese and smoked fish pancake roll ups? Ick! There are about 10,000 things she recommends doing with waffles but these are not unique recipes - these are tips, hints, and VARIATIONS. Cover waffles with ice cream, meringue, pancakes, ham, make them a sandwich, cook them with curry and dip them in fish paste. YUCKO!"
106,"This is Such a great book! I have a sourdough starter from a friend and this book shows you how to care for it along with wonderful recipes. There are so many great stories that even without the recipes it would be a great book. I love the muffins, they don't taste like sourdough at all! I will say that if you don't know how to bake bread you should get another book along with it. I would recommend ""Beard on Bread."" Don't trust him for sourdough, he dose not like it. His recipe for sourdough calls for milk with Ruth Allman says causes spoilage."
107,"As a recipe book, this isn't all that great. The waffles are pretty good and the biscuits are enjoyable (especially with some whole wheat flour mixed in), but overall there aren't that many recipes.I enjoyed the writing style and anecdotes, but I was hoping for more recipes.On the positive side, the author does not make the reader feel that using sourdough is difficult or mysterious, but makes it attainable for the novice."
108,I already have a couple of Sourdough books and I was looking for a bit more detail. This book was partially what I was looking for and had some good tips. I would buy it again but am still looking for a bit more detail and information about using it. Additional recipes ie: biscuits and whole grain breads would be more along what I want.
109,"This book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but Ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in Alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen, just a pot of sourdough."
110,"The book is a basic ""how to"" book for using sourdough. The author obviously has lots of experience cooking with a sourdough starter.I would have loved more recipes, but I did go search for my more on the internet."
111,"What a wonderful book.Ordered 2 for my Uncle.He loved it to,and it has some of the best sourdough recipes around. Try it."
112,"We purchased this book based on a recommendation to create our own sourdough ""start"". The book is detailed and very informative. We have enjoyed creating our own sourdough start. It is amazing that you should leave the sourdough start on the counter for up to a year to have a stronger flavor."
113,"We had been looking for a sourdough starter for quite awhile. When I saw the Alaska Sourdough kit offer on Amazon, I immediatly ordered it. When it arrived a few days later, the fun began! We made buscuits, pancakes, bread, bread sticks and are still going strong. I keep several buscuits in the fridge for quick snacks. Pop one or two in the microwave and douse with butter.The sourdough is very flavorable and easy to regenerate.I would recommend this product to anyone who has a taste for sourdough products..."
114,"got this for my daughter in NC, she is now making prefect bread. Wish she lived closer to make me some"
115,This book is loads of fun if you are interested in the history of Alaska Sourdough. The handwritten pages are quaint and homey. The stories are fun and recipies delicious.
116,"Frankly, ""Alaska Sourdough"" will not suit everyone's tastes. Don't get me wrong, ""Alaska Sourdough"" is as much interesting from an historical standpoint as it is for the unique recipes derived from ""on the trail"" sourdoughs who purportedly derived these concoctions over many, many years of preserving their stock of sourdough. One gets the feeling that sourdough was the lifeblood--the sustaining force--that kept many of Alaska's intrepid miners and inevitable shysters alive when all other earthly endeavors and pleasures had evaporated.The unique uses for sourdough (makes a wonderful glue, did you know?) keeps the book moving forward, and the recipes can be a bit bizarre, especially the numerous uses of mixing clams in pancake and muffin recipes. If you're looking for more practical recipes, Ruth Allman includes those as well in what appears to be a handwritten book, simulating the feel of recipes jotted down on note cards or loose pieces of paper. The section on waffles and pancakes I found to be very useful; however, the section on creating basic sourdough bread seemed to be laborious compared to the many no-knead methods other sourdough experts espouse. A good sourdough starter is its own leavening agent, creating a dough that will rise on its own. Allman's recipes frequently encourage the use of baking soda, baking powder, and even commercial yeast to speed up the respective recipe processes. This concept might not set too well with traditional sourdough bakers.""Alaska Sourdough"" does not take too long to peruse. After doing so, I did a little research on Ruth Allman and her husband and found their influence to be substantial in the Juneau, Alaska community in the early 20th Century. I would encourage anyone who found the historical aspect of ""Alaska Sourdough"" to be compelling to look into the House of Wickersham and Ruth Allman's interesting involvement in its development and perpetuation."
117,"I received this book as a BD gift... I love it! I live in SE Alaska, a subsistance life style... been trying to learn how to ""grow"" a really good sourdough... this book has been really helpful and it has some really great recipes from the early 1900's and before! Now, if I can just figure out the quirks of baking and keeping a good sourdough ""growing"" on my salmon troller...If you love great sourdough, give this a try... ""grow"" your own using one of Ruth's recipes (included)... it is well worth the time and your guests will truly enjoy the meals you make from your sourdough jar...h. akinsnaukati, ak"
118,"Do you want to brought up to speed on the state of the art in philosophical discussions of free will? Do you want to give yourself a top-flight graduate course on this exciting philosophical topic? Then read Robert Kane's The Oxford Handbook on Free Will. This book might be the single best book to study if one wants a comprehensive overview of most of the controversies unfolding in debates about free will and moral responsibility. The essays are all outstanding. Each is penned by one of the leading figures in the field, and each combines an effort to teach at a very advanced level with a novel contribution to the literature pitched from the perspective of the author. For example, in the section devoted to compatibilism (the view that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism), Kane includes four essays, one by Bernard Berofsky, another by Ishtiyaque Haji, a third by Paul Russell, and a forth by Daniel Dennett and Christopher Taylor. Each essay is detailed, crisp, completely informed, and clear as a bell. Each also advances the author's own views. Reading through this section, one can learn exactly what is now taking place in the arena of compatibilism. The same can be said about the section devoted to libertarianism (the thesis that some persons act from a sort of free will that requires the falsity of determinism). In this section, Kane includes probably the four finest philosophers currently defending this topic, Tim O'Connor, Randy Clarke, Carl Ginet, and Kane himself.In all, there are eight sections to Kane's collection with a total of 25 essays. The sections are devoted to the following topics: 1) theological issues as they pertain to free will, 2) theories of physics and the free will problem, 3) the consequence argument (a highly influential argument for the thesis that determinism is incompatible with the ability to do otherwise), 4) compatibilism, 5) the relevance of alternative possibilities for moral responsibility (some philosophers think that the freedom to act otherwise is not required for moral responsibility), 6) libertarian views, 7) non-standard views about the relationship between free will, moral responsibility and determinism (such as the view that no one has free will or moral responsibility regardless of the truth or falsity of determinism), and finally, 8) neuroscientific influences on our understanding of the free will topic. An impressive range of topics indeed.I have been publishing and writing on the topics of free will and moral responsibility for over 10 years now and I simply know of no single collection that even approximates the impressive quality and breadth of Kane's handbook. It is an outstanding book."
119,"So far forth, the editors of the Oxford Handbook series have managed to put together products which both the neophyte and the fully-informed scholar will find beneficial. Robert Kane has certainly done his part to keep up the trend.All of the essays in this volume are written by philosophers who have made significant individual contributions to the contemporary discussion about human freedom. Most of the authors have also produced influential works in related fields (philosophy of mind, action theory and moral psychology), and many of them are thoroughly conversant with the relevant empirical research in physics and neuroscience. Indeed, parts II and VIII of the book are dedicated, respectively, to the interplay between the problems of free will and quantum physics/chaos theory on the one hand, and recent work in neuroscience on the other. The result is a compilation of essays written with the sort of texture and philosophical sensitivity that repays careful (re-)reading, and brimming with suggestive ideas that could well move the debate into some relatively unexplored terrain. (We should expect nothing less from a volume edited by Kane, who has himself long advocated the importance of approaching the ancient problem of free will from novel directions.) What's more, the collection includes essays from several philosophers whose own books on free will are, though quite important and valuable, somewhat cost prohibitive. (Anyone living on a graduate student's salary who's tried to pick up a copy of Pereboom's or Clarke's or Double's or Strawson's books will know what I mean.) So the expense of the present volume is, when seen in that light, thoroughly justifiable. In fact it's a steal! Or so I've tried to convince my wife.Finally, with his characteristic combination of clarity and rigor, Kane provides a lengthy introduction to the book that will help both the professional philosopher and the new-comer find their bearings in this complex debate with as little intellectual turmoil as can reasonably be hoped for. The book is a good one, highly recommended."
120,"I first encountered Bob Kane's skill with the daedal discipline of free will in his book *The Significance of Free Will.* At that time, I realized that Kane had an almost suspicious talent for articulating my own objections, and then articulating a response that would often satisfy me more than my own.While such a talent may be a bit threatening for readers aiming to claim their own victories, Kane's affability and enthusiasm always leave the reader not only with the necessary knowledge, but with a sense of pride in having participated in his well-authenticated jaunts.This work, in particular, highlights Kane's skills as both an original author and an editor with an honest eye for the best arguments of his opponents. It will certainly become a staple, if it has not already, for professional scholars of free will and curious by-standers alike. The *Oxford Handbook of Free Will* draws together balanced selections from the most relevant authors in the field, and-despite its depth-manages to cover a range broad enough that the book would be equally well placed on the shelves of theologians, philosophers, and physicians.My main criticism is that the compilation elides some selections that, to me, seem indispensable. Then again, such a problem *should* be inevitable for a field as factious as free will, and is blunted by Kane's need to balance his equations.The Oxford group has again demonstrated their wisdom in selecting Kane as the editor of this volume. Compared to its competitors in the prosy pantheon of free-will texts, this selection will leave you energized to gnaw through the next puzzle (rather than feeling deflated by the fact that there remain more arguments to be broached).-Christian P. Erickson, M.D.christianerickson@alumni.duke.edu"
121,Awesome Preview of Europe for those of us who can't sit down and read the other guide books. The pictures and maps are great.
122,"This book is great. DK Travel books are the best available. The only problem I had was the seller""Discount Books"". They charged me a $9.95 monthly membership fee for buying the book. And they will charge it every month until you catch them and ask them to stop. That is one thing I wouldn't have expected from an Amazon vendor. "" Buyer Beware"" is a must--even here."
123,"I love the pictures in this book and brief history of each country/culture at the beginning of each chapter. It is a great overview of European sites and helps us decide what's most important for us to visit! I'm enjoying it very much. It's not like a Rick Steves book, with in-depth reviews of each area, but it's a great overall review for people like us who haven't been to Europe yet and are trying to decide what we would like to see. Rick's books are excellent for more in-depth visits, but this is great for first-timers trying to figure it all out."
124,"it is a good book, which give you more information, photo, picutre, and image of all interesting places in europe... for the traveler I would like to suggest you to buy this book coupled with lonely planet... with both book you will have a complimentary information and give you more idea to select the best place to visit, and see...."
125,"This book was an excellent buy. I recently had a holiday in Europe and it never left my side. It is packed with information, pictures and maps and in fact people travelling with me kept borrowing it all the time and were going to buy it when they got home because it had all the information they wanted to show family and friends as to where they had been and what they had seen. Highly recommended."
126,"I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go, and once you are there."
127,"This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is ""clean and proper"" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are ""tourist guides"" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment."
128,"I admit it: I'm addicted to travel. My wife and I are semi-retired and we are on the go half the year. We travel for our home-based business, ""The Nurses Choice"" which cover 50 metro areas and therefore must visit a variety of cities. We then decided to expand overseas.Having to plan for a trip to Europe, we searched for a guide that would provide what we needed. The ""Eyewitness Travel Guides"" offered a total package. Good maps, photos, recommended places to see, dine, and stay. It's well-organized and relatively small. We brought it on the tours of France and Italy. It served us well, allowing us to find and decide what to see fairly readily. A friend just borrowed it and they said the same thing. It really aided their decisions and provided a reliable course of action. We plan to buy the other series for other locations. That should speak for itself."
129,"This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!"
130,"The Dk Travel guides are the best travel guides produced, each one a high quality illustrated encyclopedia on the country or city it represents. They are invaluable guides. The only disadvantage is that they are a bit on the heavy side, but the quality of printing and extensive range of color photos offsets that."
131,"This book was tailor made for our trip, which was for 3 weeks, hitting 8 major cities. It was useful for planning as well as a take-along guide. We traveled by train, and the book was great for ""getting our heads in the game"" for the next stop. The pictures are rich with detail, including cut-away views of many historical structures like castles and cathedrals. The historical synoptic narratives are extremely well written, delivering maximum information in the space available. The quality of the paper is impeccable, with a glossy finish and gorgeous colors.My 13-year old daughter, unexpectedly and unprompted, devoured the book during the train rides. She set aside her DVD player and forty or so movies, and focused on the book - day, after day, after day. She never watched a movie on the trains. When she finished studying the section on our next city, she moved outward in the book to other features of the country. She would go back and forth between the various city descriptions, the country maps, and the map of Europe. We would go into museums, and she would point out pictures she had seen in the book. Eventually, she had carefully looked over every page of the book and read far more than just what was relevant to our destinations. She probably reread the section on Anne Frank 10 times, even though we didn't get to Amsterdam and she has already read two books on the subject. Tomorrow morning, a Saturday with me off work, she and I are going to sit down together and go through the book, tabbing the sections that cover places we went. At the expense of sounding schmaltzy, I expect it will be a sentimental keepsake for the rest of her life.This is a great book for early planning, especially if you haven't decided on which cities to visit. On the other hand, if you've already made up your mind and you are visiting fewer than four cities, this is probably not the book for you - you wouldn't buy an encyclopedia if you only wanted to read three articles. Buying the book early can give you time to buy a more focused book for cities where you find you need more information.The binding on the book will appear somewhat unusual if you're unfamiliar with this publisher as I was. Sitting on a bookshelf, it looks like a hardbound book in a colorful dust jacket, even though there is no removable jacket at all. In fact, it is sort of a hybrid between a paperback and a hardbound book. The cover is actually vinyl: solid but flexible and looks and feels almost like it is plastic coated. The cover extends above and below the pages like a hard cover. One negative is that it is fairly heavy for a relatively small book. This is because of the 800, full-color, glossy pages in a book that is less than 1.25 inches thick. The other dimensions are roughly 8.5 X 5.25.I'm sorry, but I've got to take a shot at some of the negative reviews. Some criticized a lack of depth. What do you expect with 20 countries covered in 800 pages and content split between pictures, historical narrative, and touring advice that gets all the way down to restaurants and shopping? This book is a careful compromise between breadth and depth. (Our next trip will be to only three cities, and we'll buy more focused books then.) Frankly, I don't see how the publishers could have crammed more information into such a compact space. To the fellow who said the only Eastern European country covered was Czechoslovakia: (1) it's the Czech Republic, and (2) are Hungary and Poland not part of Eastern Europe? To the person who said the maps were not useful, I have to point out that maps that can actually help navigation typically can't fit on pages this small. What do you want, 200 foldout maps in an 800 page book?BTW, we brought along a set of maps that we had bought online. Surprisingly to us, we ended up mostly relying on the free ones available in the three, four, and five star hotels we stayed in. We never failed to get a good map from a hotel front desk or concierge. Even after all the preliminary study (also, my wife and I had been to most of the cities before), we often asked for suggestions on sites and several times made some new discoveries that way. We brought along a Garmin GPS, but used it very little because we were on foot, and the Garmin instructions used street names while the streets were often unmarked. (Try looking on the sides of buildings for street names.)Bottom Line: You are investing a significant amount of money, time, and sweat equity in your trip. While it isn't cheap as books go, in the greater context of trip expenses, this book is practically free. Probably the most significant cost is the weight allowance it eats up. (Put it in your carry-on; the airlines haven't started weighing those yet.) In the uses that I've described, it can significantly enhance your experience. When you get back, it will look good on your bookshelf. If you are still deciding on which cities to go to, or if you are going to more than a few cities, buy this book. You'll thank yourself, again and again, just as I thanked my wife.Bon voyage ..... buon viaggio ..... ibuen viaje ..... and, lest we forget, ..... gute fahrt!"
132,"It's a good book, but the maps are not very good, covering only parts of central areas and there aren't subway maps. Moreover there isn't anything about hostels!"
133,"I really like the eyewitness guides, I have seven including ""Europe"". All of them have tons of images, walking routes throught various cities, contact information for sites, hotel listings, resturants, and in many cases floor plans of museums and other buildings. I also like the fact that they give some history of the country, show images of the currancy, list suggested times to visit very busy sites and show some of the reasons why you would select to visit particular attractions.True this book does not cover all of Europe, but it does have sections on the more ""popular"" travel destinations. It is good if you want some general information on many different countries and to help determine which you have interest in visiting. It is not to large to carry around and has extended cover flaps to help mark the section.The last thing is that if you are traveling to only one country or going to spend a most of your time in one city, look for the individual eyewitness guides. The information in the Ireland book was better for the two week visit to Ireland, where this book (the Europe book) would have been only ok for that trip, but was perfect for the three days in Edinburgh and helping to select which countries to visit when we only had time for a few days in each."
134,"The Eyewitness Travel Guides in general provide lots of pretty pictures and are very nice, but if you want a handy, practical guide to TAKE WITH YOU on a trip you are much better off with the Rick Steves, Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's series of travel guides. The other guides provide much better info on logistics like where to stay, where to eat, and transportation. Eyewitness (DK Publishing) makes great coffee table books, and that is what this book is. I recommend Rick Steves Best of Europe, or Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring if you want a more useful guide."
135,"I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
136,i LIKE THIS BOOK VERY MUCH i HOPE IT WILL BE VERY USEFUL ON MY NEXT TRIP TO EUROPE. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION
137,I bought this book because we are moving to Germany and I wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in Europe that we could travel too. Unfortunately pages 457-480 on Greece are not in English - looks to be Spanish. There was some sort of printing problem! But I found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries.
138,"I bought this book to help me plan my trip to Europe and it was so useful, it was the only book I packed to take on my trip. The book covers mainly Western Europe along with Poland, Czech Republic, Hungry, and Greece. The former Soviet Union, former Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia are not covered and neither are the islands of Iceland, Malta, and Cyprus. Similarly, of the ""tiny"" countries, only Monaco and the Vatican are mentioned; Liechtenstein, Andorra, and San Marino are not.The book describes what is available to see in Europe. For each country, about six to twenty cities/regions are discussed and for major cities (e.g. London, Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, etc.) there is more detailed coverage, such as six to twenty sights within that city along with a city map. Usually, each attraction gets about a four-paragraph write-up plus a photograph. A few major attractions (e.g. Louvre, British Museum, St. Peter's Cathedral, etc.) are devoted two to four pages plus a larger diagram. Also, each country usually has another dozen or so pages covering its history and culture as well as a discussion about practical information such as climate, banking, methods of travel, shopping, etc.The book doesn't teach you everything you need to know about Europe (e.g. nothing about foreign languages), or will want to know (e.g. hotels, restaurants, and food have modest coverage). Nor does it include everything you'll do - only places, not events, are written about (e.g. Oktoberfest only warrants a photo). But the book does an excellent job at detailing what popular, famous, interesting, or important places there are in Europe. The pictures and illustrations make the book come to life. The maps help you judge the relative positions of sights within a particular city. The descriptions are usually detailed enough so you can determine how interesting you'll find a particular place. Some people might criticize the book because it doesn't judge how ""good"" each sight is. However, I find this nice because everyone has different tastes and I like to have the opportunity form my own opinions.If you want to know what is available to see in Europe then this is the book for you."
139,"If you're already a fan of the Eyewitness Travel Guide series, you know what to expect from this book. If this is your first time, let me tell you you'll be amazed with how great and how useful this book is.This particular guide summarizes the contents of over 20 other books by DK, including information for 20 countries in total, organized in the following way:- The British Isles (Great Britain &amp; Ireland)- France and the low countries (France, Belgium, Luxembourg &amp; The Netherlands)- The Iberian Peninsula (Spain &amp; Portugal)- Italy and Greece- Germany, Austria and Switzerland- Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark &amp; Finland)- Central and Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary &amp; Poland).This guide contains, for every country, information regarding sites to visit, hotels, restaurants, shopping, museums, travel info (how tos for travelling by train, bus, car, metro, etc). Worthy of notice are their trademark cutaways of castles and churches, maps and street-by-street graphics.The only drawback is that since it includes information on so many countries, some of it might not have the detail you'd expect. For example, the France section has only 73 pages, while the Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris (another book from DK) has over 350 pages on Paris alone!A phenomenal guide if you're planning on visiting many countries on one trip, but if you intend to dedicate more time to just a couple, you'd be better off getting the specific country/city guides."
140,"Yes, this is one heavy book. It is more than likely not a guide you want to carry around with you unless you intend to lose a few pounds from the extra weight in your backpack. Otherwise, it is quite a great guide for deciding where you want to take your next vacation in Europe. It is filled with color photography, illustrations and details you wil enjoy reading. It is graphically exciting and visually pleasing. Of all the guides I've seen, the Eyewitness Travel Guides are sheer brillance.On the inside cover there is a map of Europe and then the pages are color coded so you can find the following countries: Great Britian, Ireland, France, Belgium & Luxembourge, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.So, if you wanted to find the information on France, you just turn the book sideways and look for the yellow markings on the pages. Viola, you are there. If you are dreaming about visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre or want to go see the Hall of Mirrors at the Chateau de Versailles, may I say...they are worth a plane ticket to France. Finding a bottle of Huile D' Olive in the South of France is also something you won't soon forget.There is also a guide to Europe's Rail Network and the Index is perfect.After you look through the main spots to visit in each country, there is a section filled with practical information: Visa Requirements and customs, tourist information, personal security issues, climate, banking, communications, directory for embassies, travel information like car rental and buses, etc. Then there is a shopping and entertainment. So where do you want to stay? There is a guide giving the hotel ratings and it is divided up by the areas you might enjoy visiting. Then, there is a guide to places to eat. While finding a restaurant just by exploring can be exciting, there is something to be said for a guide. Unless of course you happen to be traveling with someone who knows the country and I can imagine that is the best way to travel. Is there a lonely Frenchman out there who wants to show me Paris? SighJust kidding, but hey, a fantasy is a fantasy.So, think of this guide as an overview and then you can select an Eyewitness Travel Guide for the specific countries of interest. They are all excellent although on a first trip to Europe, I'd advice a guided tour so you can enjoy your trip instead of worrying about language barriers, etc.If you go to Paris, take a tour because I would not drive there if you paid me a million bucks! The highways in Germany are also equally terrifying. Everyone is in such a hurry to get to nowhere. If you want to enjoy your vacation without as many hassles, a tour might be the way to go. There is nothing quite like being guided through the most gorgeous cities in Europe.This guide is just the start to many adventures.~The Rebecca Review"
141,"Eyewitness travel guides are splendid and this is not an exception. This is a handy guide to Europe and shows some of the more popular spots to travel to. I was a bit confused that not all countries were included. However, that might be because they picked the places that most people travel to. I personally was a bit disapointed that Romania, Ukraine and other more far eastern european countries were not included. However, still and all, this is an awesome guide for the countries that are included. I love how they show everything instead of just writing and writing like many travel guides do. These are the best guides out there and the many photos make these guides stupendous and astounding and many leagues better then closest competitor."
142,"I recently took a backpack trip through Europe, which lasted close to a month; before heading out there I went through a few guidebooks and at that moment this one appealed the most. I cannot say if it was the presentation with the colored photographs; maps of the cities with visitor information or that I was just to plain sick of spending time searching for a guide book to take me though my journey. Nonetheless I am quite pleased that I took this guide with me. I had planned initially to visit a friend in Netherlands and spend some time scrolling through the cities; I left my guide there to my host; but off and on I would reference the book with places I visited; I must admit that this book covered all the places. Now of course I personally feel the best way to visit a place is to have some one show you around as like any other travel guide will not detail the places where the locals would head over to; like the bars, restraunts and night clubs. My visit from here lead me to Paris; it hit me with all its charm and glamour; here too I was fortunate to be taken around by friends. The real use of the guide came when I went on a solo journey to Belgium Austria and Italy. I found this guide an immense source of information. On my way to the city mostly by trains; I found the chance to orient myself and somewhat have a time frame as to how long I would stay in each city. I found that even though the book has information about hotels and hostels but at the train station's Hotel Guides; I was always able to get better deals. Pretty much I carried this heavy 800 pages book with me where ever I went.Even though this book provides immense information I would highly recommend getting additional reference books on cities, which are known, for immense sightseeing and historical attractions. One such place where the guide fell short was Florence; even tough it has considerable information and provides all the most popular sites. It literally will take a 1000 pages to detail all the places to visit; as a comparison there are over 78 places to visit which have historical importance but the book has listed only about the best 14 of them; well visiting all the places would take a few weeks of stay in comparison to a typical 3-4 days that tourists generally spend; which is sufficient time to visit the places listed in the book. Another important place not mentioned in this test was the ""Museum of Arsenal"" in Vienna; here on display is the car in which duke Ferdinand traveled with in Sarajevo.On the whole this covers only the most western countries of Europe and leaves a lot of East European countries and Turkey as well."
143,"This guide is great for an overview of many of the great places in Europe - but I cannot believe anyone would consider using this as their only guide. It should be used to maybe narrow down places to visit- then more comprehensive guides should be used. I have never been a believer in those 1 and 2 days in 18 cities over 3 weeks tours. 1 or 2 days is certainly not enough time to fully appreciate and get to know any city you visit. Furthermore, this guides biggest flaw is in doesn't cover anything in central/eastern europe besides the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary! Where's Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, the Baltic States, etc....? Yes, Europe is big but the countries not contained in this guide have so much to offer and certainly should not be overlooked. For example, St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - not mentioned here!Don't rush Europe - relax and enjoy it. Take time to get to know the people and cities. This guide can certainly help to narrow down Europe - but should certainly not be relied upon for extensive info on the many great places."
144,"This is a condensed and abridged book covering most of Europe. It gives you the highlights of the countries of Western Europe. It is a good book if you planning a trip where you will spend a day or two in many places. Otherwise you should consider DK more comprehensive guides to a particular country, region or city. On the positive side the book covers several countries that DK does not have a guide for yet. On the down side, the only Eastern European countries covered are Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Also the book is heavy. Is the book worth the money? Only if you are taking a &quot;buffet&quot; tour of Europe (a little France, a little Italy, etc...)."
145,"I just returned from a two-week tour of Western Europe and this book was simply fantastic. Obviously you can't cover everything you could possibly do in Europe in 800 pages, but this book covered more than many of the other Europe tomes. I had this book and one other with me on my trip and this was the only book I opened the entire journey.The best part about this book was all of the illustrations and color photographs. This book shows you what the other guides only tell you. It's hard to tell what building your looking at if you only have a written description, but with the four color illustrations in this book things are easy to identify and find. I would recommend this book to anyone taking a trip to Europe. (Plus, when you get back from your trip this book can even help you identify all those photographs you took)"
146,"All Europe guides are, of necessity, a selection of the very best things to see and do in that vast continent. No one book could be comprehensive, and all Europe guides are pretty bulky and heavy. But the Eyewitness people have managed to fit an astonishing number of places into 800 pages - and their choices are always exactly right, especially for the first-time visitor. It can be hard to decide whether to go to Antwerp or Bruges or Brussels - if you only have time to go to one city in Belgium - and all the photographs and illustrations in this book, plus the informative descriptions, make it a lot easier to make up your mind. The maps alone, all in color, make it worth buying."
147,"This guide is great when considering what sites and places to visit. It covers most any city you might find yourself visiting. It does a great job of describing the sites and the history behind them. Does not help with city transportation. Lightly covers the character of each city. I do enjoy the pictures and diagrams in the book. I highly recommend having another guide book that covers more logistics. I used this book along with Rick Steves Europe 2007. They were great companions to one another. My other complaint is that I am a student with a budget. This book does not cover many (if any) cheap places to eat or sleep. It does tell you which places charge admission, but does not tell you the admission price. It is a great book when accompanied by another (like Lonely Planet or Rick Steves.)"
148,"one of the best first person accounts of real bow hunting for any and all game on earth. detailed review of hunts, personal thoughts and technique in an easy to read format.excellent building details of the american long bow and equipment.a wealth of information on archery techniques as well as sportsmanship."
149,"I received my book on a friday and read it cover to cover in two days. I loved it. Howard Hill was not only the greatest archer in the world, but an excellent story teller. He does everything from shooting a buffalo while riding a horse, to bowfishing under water and shooting a large shark. He even has a technical chapter on bowmaking, and his style of shooting. Any archer will enjoy reading this book."
150,"exellent book for the beginning archer, it gets you excited to get out and try archery"
151,Hunting the Hard Way is the best book I have ever read. This book is about the adventures of Howard Hill and others that accompanied him on his hunting trips. Howard Hill used a laminated bamboo longbow that he made in his archery shop. He was an excellent shot with the bow also. He took some amazing shots at animals in this book. The most amazing shot in my opinion was at an elk at over 150 yards! He also went hunting with his bow and arrow.
152,"The first 2 chapters of this book locked this reader to the pages like an arrow nocked to the string. The thoughts and feelings expressed by Howard Hill as he came to full draw on each of his adventures put me in the saddle or atop the mountain looking through his eyes. Any archer's heart will race at the reaccounting of each hunt, but only archers of traditional caliber will be able to appreciate the flight of the arrow as it's loosed and hits its intended mark. The bond between fellow hunters is well expressed and gives proper account to the knowledge and wisdom passed down at the campfire by older more experienced hunters. But for the fact that Howard Hill has accomplished things with his bow that I wouldn't begin to consider, I found it difficult to associate with some of his underwater adventures."
153,"If you are involved with archery, this book belongs in your library. Howard Hill posessed skills that are nothing short of incredible when it came to hunting and target archery. This book will inspire you to pick up your bow and go out and shoot. It might even inspire someone to but down his compound and pick up a real bow. This book is a compilation of accounts from Howards career that would be written off as fantasy if so many people hadn't witnessed what Howard was able to accomplish with a longbow. Howard attempts to describe making bows and other archery tackle. I wouldn't buy the book for these reasons. There are other sources such as the bowyer's bible series that do a much better job."
154,Just incredible to hear these stories. Really was a much more innocent time. Fully of helpful insights for would be traditional archers
155,"I have no quarrel with the book itself. Wanted a copy for a long time. However, I purchased a used book with the understanding that it was a ""Signed Copy."" The copy I received WAS NOT autographed. This is a disappointment. If you advertise it as an autographed copy, don't substitute one that isn't. Leaves me in serious doubt regarding furture purchases. I'd appreciate some clarification. Regards, Elmer Kurrus"
156,This was a great book if you are a archery hunter it is a must read. Has motivate me to pit down the compound and pick up a longbow.
157,"Howard Hill's classic book on the longbow and hunting is filled with recommendations, tips, and wisdom earned over a lifetime of traditional archery. A great read that will be sure to make you a better traditional archer and bowhunter!"
158,Great read! Not an in depth how to book but full of some great adventures that one could only wish they could have been part of.
159,"This book is highly suggested for anyone interested in traditional archery. It is very entertaining and a great reference book. I've read it a couple of times and still reread sections from time to time. It gives insight into the way things were before compound bows, carbon fiber arrows, LED peep sights, etc. Heck, laminated wood was a big deal! Besides the exciting hunting stories, I liked the short course on bow and arrow construction."
160,"Thia was a gift for my Husband, who loved the book. It arrived on the date we were told it would."
161,"Seligmann, an artist and a &quot;bibliophiliac&quot; of twentieth century, presents a noteworthy panorama on the roots of magic and ancient beliefs &amp; superstitions in this richly illustrated work. This is not a book an enthustiastic &quot;Wicca&quot; would be enjoyed or feel excited to read. Rather it is a well organized collection of historical accounts (mostly dealing with the &quot;Western&quot; side of the subject) and esoteric knowledge. Seligmann provides us a classified history of magic, beginning with ancient Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Canaan and Greece; then shifts the main route towards the medieaval Europe. All sections concerning with ancient cultures has very interesting details on ancient rituals, myths and the concept of &quot;demons&quot;. He especially provides very interesting material on Hermetic philosophy and gnosticism. The hundreds of illustrations in the book, add an entertaining taste into the story. This book would have well deserved &quot;five stars&quot; if it included ancient Eastern beliefs and rites in same detailed style, so I rate Seligmann's work with 4 stars. But in general, &quot;The History of Magic and Occult&quot; is a &quot;compact encyclopedia&quot;, you'd like to own."
162,"Kurt Seligmann, Surrealist artist par excellence, admitted &amp; unashamed bibliophile, has ravaged his occult library in a miraculous marriage giving birth to this classic historical account of Magic and Occultism; entirely written for the proverbial 'man about the street', and a very cosmic avenue is here tread in an admireable chronological ordering of the various mystical houses. Addressing all the various occult(semantic definition of &quot;hidden &amp; rejected knowledge&quot;) routes via the shortcut of this Art Historian's scholarly mind, as a whole this work is one of the best and most easily approachable &quot;magic histories&quot; for those who have no previous knowledge concerning occultism except an undeniable interest and fascination with the mysterious and the spiritual.Kurt Seligmann is darkly fascinated and explores endlessly the multitude of historic beliefs concerning the study of the nature of evil... such as black magic, necromancy, Elizabethian era conjurers and their Enochian magic,primitive rites, evocations of the Cultus Satanus, Goetia Demonomania, et.al....as an example, early on he discusses Chaldean phliosophies in which: &quot;Evil was born from God's disturbing thoughts&quot;...I have long wondered if the proposed thoughts had to do specifically with humanity?...and this book will surely set the fire or fan the sulphurous flames of those burning to know more about all things occult.The book primarily deals with Western Esoteric Traditions, which, being a westerner, appeals to my insatiable explorative appetite in studying and discovering the divinity of humankind and the accorded propensity &amp; potentials of individual spiritual progress through Magick and the strengthening of divine will ; in comparison with more Eastern idealogies concerned with mystical enlightenment and the abolishing of the ego to attain Nirvana.In summation, Kurt Seligmann, as one of the last efforts of his exemplary artistic journey throughout the early 20th century avant-garde, has given the world a completely unbiased in-depth world history from a magical perspective, a genuine labor of love which will always retain its intimately artistic personality in contrast to the strict scholarly treatise of the newspaper skeptic variety; and although there are better, more developed and intrigueing accounts out there, none are at the moment so readily available and economic, nor so expressive, or conclusively compact as this. Finally, the book has over a hundred and fifty illustrations from alchemical treatise and magical grimoires which compliment his descriptive writing style.It is besides all this, another exclamation point puncuating the Surrealist movement. surrealyours, an occultist."
163,"I have the older version of the book, but I understand that the content is generally unchanged.As someone who was desperately seeking some history without the New Age spin, this is a good resource. I'm almost tempted to say excellent resource, for what's there, tho he does focus on Western and Middle Eastern concepts.The main flaw I see with the book is the writing style. It's very 'academic', which I often find is synonomous with dry. I understand why the flashy New Age books sell - they capture the audience who doesn't go for the more scholarly approach... and I have difficult reading this book without my mind wandering.That said - it's not about flash, it's about substance... and it is a very interesting and informative piece of works."

165,I recommend this book for anyone beginning to study the occult. It will give you a strong base by which to begin your studies. It is a very dry read as most occult books are. You will regualrly return to it for references throughout your studies.
166,"The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
167,"An incredible collection of stories that will make you gasp and ask for more. I originally read this book in spanish but even when it's translated, it doesn't lose any of it's magic. As you read this book and indulge in the many characters' lives, you realize that they belong to the author's imagination as much as they belong to our wonder and just as much as they belong to our own lives. After every story I had to sit back an process the incredible story I had just read. Rivera-Valdez uses her ease with words to paint not just a portrait of each character, but a landscape. Not only are you able to fully enjoy the secrets in the stories, but you will find yourself wondering what goes on behind your own neighbors' curtains."
168,"An extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use. For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library. I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above."
169,"Required reading for anyone interested in the apologists. It is also an early contribution to the study of ethnicity, culture, and identity in late antiquity -- hot topics as of late. Highlights include references to obscure German authors and meticulous readings of the source texts (not to mention the fascinating chapters on Justin and Celsus)."
170,"The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book, it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances, the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field, I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization, I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study."
171,"First, this text is not the source of the interrelation between Mediterranean Sea cultures. Every book on Hellenistic kingdoms or the Roman Empire presupposes (or should) interrelation of cultures because those political boundaries encompassed a variety of cultures. (A ""specialist"" should know this.) This text is just what it says: a chronicle of Homer and Moses citings.Second, other authors have expounded on this topic: they have, and they will again. I'm not going to explain in depth here because to do so would be to give away my doctoral thesis. I don't particularly want to see someone else take my sources, present my argument, and have my book published under his/her name.Third, it is extremely difficult to write a doctoral thesis, from my experience. So, while I cannot say that it is the best work on the topic, I think we should have sympathy for doctoral student writers. It is publish or perish, after all. At least it was published. I can only hope for so much for myself.Whether or not you the reader purchase this book is a matter of your own choice. Having to go back to the library for it too often is an indication that one is using it as a reference and not looking to the original sources. That is ill-advised. (Of course, libraries are the friends of ""specialists."") But if you have money, and it would make you happy just to peruse every now and then... then by all means give your financial support to Amazon and the author."
172,"As a Celtic and West Ham nut-case I have had the pleasure of watching Paolo play for 2 of my clubs! His passion and skill are unmatched, and his unpredictable antics are a bonus. When he was happy, West Ham were in the Top ten in the Prem. When he was un-happy West Ham were relegated. When he left, West Ham lost it's soul. I pray his last year is played in MLS for San Jose!!! (-;"
173,"yeah this is an interesting, and staunchly Anti-Jeffersonian Biography from 1883. His vantage point makes this book a pretty groovy read, though maybe not the best for facts"
174,"The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
175,"This book combines two of the most sought-after items in a biography. First, in Williams, you have an intriguing, mysterious figure who not many people have much information on. Yes, he won the Heisman trophy and he is, publically, seen as a good person.What Richardson, the most respected college sports writer in the country, is able to do is look beyond the public perception and give readers a sense of what makes Williams tick and why Williams ticks the way he does.This book sets the stage for Williams in New Orleans. It is set before Williams' rookie year with the Saints and controversial coach Mike Ditka. After reading this book, you'll understand why Williams had the turbulent year and subsequent problems.Through a network of what seem to be unparalled contacts, Richardson is able to gain an insight on Williams the college player that has never before been exposed. He sets the table for Williams' rookie year. Much of the book explains how Williams was handled in college at Texas and why his transition to the real world has been so difficult.In short, this book is a must for any pro football fan. On a grand scale, it is much more than a work about Ricky Williams and the Saints. It chronicles the reasons college players have such a difficult time making the trasition to the professional level and explains why football is only part of that equation."
176,"Written by Elizabeth Crary (a parent educator of 25 years' experience), Dealing With Disappointment: Helping Kids Cope When Things Don't Go Their Way offers parents, teachers, child care providers, and anyone else who works with children a straightforward guidance to teaching children how to meet and deal with seemingly insurmountable challenges. From learning to recognize when children are truly upset or shaken; to the dangers of trying to make or keep children happy at all times; to teaching young ones self-calming and problem-solving skills with step-by-step guides and games; to learning how to keep one's cool when the kids lose theirs, Dealing With Disappointment is an excellent and strongly recommended resource filled from cover to cover with positive and practical guidance and guidelines."
177,"This is my favorite parenting (and lifeskills) book for learning how to identify, process, and master one's feelings. It is so practical and really applies to any age of child/adult and parenting style. The goal of the book is to empower kids (and parents) to be responsible for their own feelings by identifying and handling them in appropriate ways.A variety of techniques are recommended depending on the age of the child and the child's own particular personality. (From art to music to reading to physical exercises and so much more).The author suggests that for each year of age a child has, they should develop that many coping mechanisms when they are upset for how to get their feelings under control and process them.This book strikes an excellent balance between the one extreme that says ""You have no business feeling that way - just deal with it"" which leads to stuffing emotions and angry outbursts, and the other extreme which focuses so much on talking about feelings ""You're angry, you're upset, tell me how you feel, let's focus on your feelings for hours ad nauseum"" that the child feels trapped by their own feelings and isn't given tools for moving beyond the situation.Highly highly recommend this book! You as the parent will also come away with new and better coping skills for yourself."
178,"What a relief to read this book. As parents, it's so easy to assume it's our job to keep our kids happy. This workbook teaches step by step, how to help children talk about their feelings, calm themselves, and problem solve when things don't go their way. It even reminds us what we can to do stay calm when our kids are disappointed. There are so many possibilities and sales pitches in today's world that managing disappointment is essential. Fortunately, this book teaches how."
179,A great book. A wonderful collection of images coupled with well-written essays.
180,"I had very high expectations for this book. Never having been to the national portrait gallery I wasn't sure what to expect but I thought it would be the pinnacle of portraiture. I was completely dissapointed to see the poor quality of work by well known and unknown artists alike.There are of course exceptions but they are few and far between. I gave it 3 stars because the text is excellent, it's well laid out and very fun to read."
181,"Ironically, I grew up in a small town close to The Farm, but never knew much about it. A friend asked me about it, and when forced to confront my ignorance on the subject I purchased the book to correct that shortcoming. Little did I know how much I was about to be entertained!Voices from The Farm is written--as a book on the communal living experience should be--by a number of the folks who participated. It is a collection of stories that together summarize the experience of the members, and the life-cycle of the community.The Farm and its various off-shoots accomplished some great humanitarian feats in the face of the suspicion and prejudice of its neighbors. Winning over those neighbors provides some of the most entertaining tales in the book. However, the biggest obstacles seem--as with human society in general--to be rooted in the human nature of the members of The Farm community.This book is a great, entertaining collection of stories that together tell the tale of a marvelous exercise in social science and community economics. Excellent work by the editors in preserving, selecting, and arranging the individual contributions to tell the story of The Farm."
182,"This book gave me a glimpse at life on The Farm, as described by people who'd actually lived there. While no book can EVER be a substitute for the daily reality of living on the land, trying to build a community, take care of children, raise food and get through cold winters, reading this book was still a very powerful experience. It made me think about my spiritual values and what it must have been like for those who were trying to live with a commitment to living gently on the earth, not hurting wild creatures, not using leather.I appreciated the honesty as well - as varous people would talk of giving into corruption and sneaking Dr. Pepper soda on a trip to town and other acts that went against general group values. Some of these values, of course were not overtly stated...but most were understood. Others were in a state of transition.Ultimately, the Farm broke up but this book is a powerfl reminder of all that was good about it and of the yearning for finding new ways of building stronger community lives. I have no way of knowing for sure, but I have a feeling many members of The Farm continue to live with similar values as they had back then, when they were simply thought of as crazy ""hippies""."
183,"This book contains true accounts from former residents of probably the best known intentional community, The Farm. This book can show the reader how to make a commune successful, as well as what things to avoid. It is funny at times and very interesting and educational. Take notes!"
184,I really liked hearing from my old friends. The Farm was a great learning experience and is still relevant. It's unfortunate that the pictures that had been planned for this book were left out at the last minute.
185,"Gave me a detailed vision of day to day life in a commune that is still in existence today. Very interesting, quick, delightful read!"
186,"Brought back warm memories of my brief stay at The Farm in the late 70's. Wonderful place, people, and philosophy. Often wished I'd decided to take up residence there! A great little book, quick read. Peace, Love & Blessings to y'all! (Write on, Rupert!)"
187,"Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it. Excellent photos as well.I kept looking for a photo of me and my then-wife, but I wasn't there long enough. But shewas :-)"
188,"This book is a collection of oral histories and some original documents from the early days of the famous Farm commune in Tennessee. The Farm had a fairly hierarchical structure compared to some hippie efforts, and identified as a spiritual community, with a large amount of group effort and work involved in basic infrastructure, social experiments, and, eventually, charity projects that were difficult for the cash-strapped group to support (like maintaining an ambulance service in besieged Bronx neighborhoods, hundreds of miles from the Farm home base in Tennessee, as well as projects in Central America during a guerrilla war that threatens local partners in the project).The stories are a FANTASTIC look at group dynamics and, in my opinion, give a great look at the consequences of the ""mission creep"" that idealistic projects such as nonprofits and religious organizations are prone to. Much of this is very entertaining, often in a black-humor sort of way, and gives a great look at commonalities in human nature that apply today, whether to today's version of 'hippies', or any hard-working and idealistic group of humans trying to better the world."
189,i have a copy of this book and love it and can't wait til the revised version comes out in a few weeks
190,"loved this book, first hand accounts, blazingly honest about the good and bad aspects, will make you want to go visit!"
191,"Inspirational, informative, warm in places, funny in others. Having so many former residents' stories gives a well rounded, neatly edited report. Enjoyable, fun read."
192,"Bill Harvey has a wonderful gift of making history come alive in this book. This book awakens a sense of wonder at the possiblility of a real relationship with God as you follow the faithfulness of one little girl in ancient times. Young girls ages 5-15 will love this book. It has always been one of my most loved treasures, a real Keeper !"
193,"I was introduced to this book when I was a teenager. I loved it then, and was pleasantly surprised to see it still available. Reading it again to my own children, it was better than I remembered, and loved by all of them, from ages 6 to 14. Although at times the heroine is presented as almost too good to be true, the plot of the book is exciting, and left my children asking me to read one more chapter. The setting of the book provides a great amount of historical detail, leaving the reader with an excellent understanding of the Israelites' constant fear of raiding and invasion by the Assyrians, and a good grasp of daily life in Assyria. The book takes a few unexpected twists and turns, and has enough unanswered questions throughout to keep readers of all ages interested. All in all, a very good choice to help understand this time period."
194,This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.
195,"This book is both a history and a photo album of the famous German battleship, and the photos are particularly useful in showing both the construction stages of the ship and for the many interior shots. That said, this book has a couple of problems. One is its age; it was originally published in 1975, and the authors appear not to have taken advantage of the information that appears in Ludovic Kennedy's ""Pursuit,"" published the previous year. As a result, there are statements in this book, particularly concerning the Bismarck's chronology, that have been disproved by more recent discoveries. The other big problem is the translation, which appears to have been done very literally by someone with little knowledge of naval nomenclature. Thus, ""Seekriegsleitung"" gets translated as ""sea-war-leadership,"" which may be a literal translation, but ignores the more generic term ""naval operations,"" which is what this really means. This problem becomes particularly aggravating in trying to follow the time-line of events surrounding the destruction of the Hood and the Bismarck, which, as translated, make almost no sense. The diagrams, which are in German and are not translated, seem fairly accurate, although during the destruction of the Bismarck they appear to show the King George V firing torpedos at the Bismarck, when in fact the King George V had no torpedo tubes. It's also puzzling that the translator, according to the note at the end of the book, was unaware until 1989, with the publication of Robert Ballard's book on the discovery of the Bismarck, of the number of German sailors rescued after the sinking of the Bismarck. Even here, his figures are wrong--he states that 115 men were rescued by the British. In fact, British warships rescued 111 men (one later died and was buried at sea) while a German submarine and a German weather ship rescued the other five. A marginally useful book, although much of its information has been supersceded by more recent discoveries and research."
196,I like this book first one I've seen with so many historical pictures of the ship. Well worth the money
197,"This little book is one of the most important works I have read in my 50+ years. With simple, yet incredibly powerful ideas, it challenged me to get &quot;out of my philosophical box&quot; and think again about life, God, and how it all works together. Recalling the simple statement Jesus made, that we &quot;must become like little children...&quot;, I played along with the exercises outlined in the book and found an earth-shaking change taking place in my life. Read this without judgment or prejudice -- and see for yourself!"
198,"Dr Baker explains clearly and engagingly how one can improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called treatment. The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are the God process in the individual. This wonderful work provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alia, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy, Catherine ponder and Florence Scovel-Shinn, this book should be read repeatedly to provide the maximum benefit."
199,"Dr. Barker opened the First Church of Religious Science in New York City in 1946, was President of the International New Thought Alliance and a well-known minister, author and teacher throughout the New Thought movement. This classic book is often used in Religious Science classes. Dr. Barker explains how to change the subconscious pattern through spiritual treatment. Some of his statements: There are unfortunately a great many people with attractive surface attitudes but with the same old rubbish underneath (9), If you fail to direct your subconscious mind, it produces under a law of averages, and you are a nice, ineffective sweet person (84), I call treatment mind surgery. It is the way in which you go into the subconscious, destroy old patterns and instill new ones (90)."
200,"Raymond Charles Barker believes in metaphysics, but you need not share his views on such a weighty topic to derive benefit from this book. Treat Yourself to Life is a manual for productive living -- a self-help book you might say -- and Barker provides a straight-forward approach for getting what you want in terms of love, wealth, health and self-expression.Skeptics may cringe at the author's faith in the individual to create his own destiny through the book's teaching, but Barker responds by urging the reader to assess the merits of the teaching based on real results for the individual.The books divides into chapters on Happiness, Wealth, Love, This Day, Success, Freedom and Life, and offers a method to improve one's experience with regard to each. Barker demands faith and effort, but at its core, the method really does not differ much from techniques in cognitive therapy and sqaures with the latest views on neuroplasticity, at least in my view. Yet the teaching seems more positive and offers a greater faith in human nature. Surely, the reader will have to decide for himself."
201,"Dr Baker was one of those great 20th century metaphysicians like Emmet Fox, Ernest Holmes &Thomas Troward, who understood the working of the mind long before psychotherapy became popular. This approach is called ""the religion of healthy mindedness"" by William James in his classicThe Varieties of Religious Experience.Barker explains clearly and engagingly how to improve one's life by changing your subconscious pattern through the spiritual technique called `treatment.' The essence of treatment is this: When the conscious mind of the individual deliberately selects a creative idea and delivers that idea to the subconscious, the subconscious mind acts as a law and proceeds to produce the equivalent of that idea in the individual's experience. The subconscious mind is the producer of one's experience, while the conscious mind is the decider of experience. Both phases of mind are spiritual processes working together - they are thedivine thought processin the individual.This wonderful guide provides a spiritual technique for richer living. Chapters deal with, inter alias, Happiness, Wealth, Love, Success and Freedom, and includes helpful affirmations and prayers. On a par with the work of Joseph Murphy,Catherine Ponderand Florence Scovel-Shinn, the book should be read repeatedly to derive the maximum benefit."
202,"Considered a classic in the field, TREAT YOURSELF TO LIFE continues to be regarded as one of the best of many guides available to deal with life's challenges. Dr. Barker emphasizes that most psychological techniques lack a spiritual premise with which to bring health, prosperity, and well-balanced personal relationships into action. By changing the subconscious patterns that derail even the best of intentions, you can reprogram yourself for success through Dr. Barker's spiritual mind treatment approach. In getting this book, you are doing something of value for yourself."
203,"Along with ""The Power of Decision,"" Neville's ""Power of Awareness"" and ""The Search"" (in ""The Awakened Imagination,"") some of the best New Thought books, ever."
204,This book is for anyone who wishes to take control of their life.It gives clear instructions and contains the age old formula of success.
205,I bought this book when I was a kid. I've lost track of how many times I've read it. It's one of my all time favorite books. I wish there were more books like this.
206,The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages.
207,A great resource for paper type crafts. From paper mache to origami this book gives you projects you can follow right from the book or inspirations for your own creations. Clear instructions and excellent step by step photos. Tried some of the projects myself with success and had fun with the kids doing it. Great for a sunny day when you want to do something different or are stuck inside on a rainy day.
208,"Security specialist Micah Lassiter finds himself in an ethical quandary when wealthy businessman Alan Street hires him to protect his daughter, and Micah quickly finds his heart becoming involved. Allen owns one of the most successful software companies in the world, which now has made him the target of threats. The man sending threatening letters is obviously brilliant, unbalanced and dangerous. Concerned for his daughter, Alan wants someone to keep an eye on Prudence night and day to ensure her safety. But Micah must protect Prudence without her knowledge. She has struggled hard to establish her independence from her father and won't welcome his intrusion now, however well meaning.Micah moves into the apartment across the hall from Prudence, using his proximity to arrange quiet dinners and intimate moments. By necessity, Prudence believes he's courting her, and is confused by his mixed signal when he kisses her on one day and then emotionally distances himself the next. Micah is equally confused by his reactions, knowing that emotional involvement can endanger her safety. Prudence becomes the cause of some real soul searching, as their relationship takes a path he didn't expect. As danger escalates, Micah finds not just her life in danger, but his heart. Further, she won't be tolerant when she finds out her father hired him.Ruth Langan deftly combines danger and romance in BY HONOR BOUND. Langan has a gift for creating wonderful characters. The direct confrontation of the ethical issues provides striking characterizations with believable dilemmas. Her secondary characters likewise sparkle, from the Lassiter family to the meddlesome sisters that live in the same apartment building as Alan and Prudence. Unexpectedly delightful, BY HONOR BOUND comes highly recommended."
209,"It's pretty cool looking at one of these maps that started out as satellite photos and then were filled in with cartographic caricatures (with prime features exaggerated out of scale). You are musing ""wow, I didn't know that was out there,"" and pretty soon you're in the car heading out to see something that no one you know ever heard of. I found something on this map out in the vastness of Kansas called the Chalk Hills, looked it up, it's all on private land but apparently the owners don't mind, there are no fences visible and no other tourists, and there are these natural wonders for you to grok at.http://www.kansasphototour.com/chalk.htmhttp://www.kansasphototour.com/castle.htmhttp://www.ourks.com/chalkpyramids.htmlI have one of these in my own backyard, the Sutter Butteshttp://www.middlemountain.org/picture.htmin the upper part of the Central Valley of California.It is normally invisible in Sacramento because of either smog or agricultural dust. I had never seen it, one day it rained and I saw this magic mountain rising out of the plain. I went to bed, had a dream about it, got up out of my sleep and had to drive there. (Unfortunately, the locals glare at you because of all the bad tourists, and this one is fenced, with some places with weird manhole covers and red-&-white striped antennas sticking up out of the ground.)"
210,"This map is clear and informative, but more than that, it is beautiful to look at.Ordering it from the UK, I would have liked a quicker delivery option. But it arrived more or less when they promised -- if anything, a week sooner than I expected.Thoroughly satisfied with this purchase."
211,"Due to the time-lag up to the present (5-9 years after the original publication) it needs to be pointed out that some of the essays may have lost shreds from their novelty; while others, like Al Hidell's charting out the EuroAtlantic grand chessplayers' ulterior geostrategical motives (among them g.o.d.= guns, oil/pipelines, drugs) leading up to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia and to the birth of their latest stepchild, say, in the form of Kosovo, are timelier than ever.

212,"I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly."
213,"I bought this to help understand care issues specific to the Birman breed, and it really helped. The section on exhibition was interesting, but not really relevant to my needs. It was great to have sections on feeding, grooming, temperament, and health that were tailored specifically to the Birman, since this breed of cat is very unique. It goes into detail on health issues of the Birman such as the breed's propensity for kidney disease and the importance of annual blood work. The book also talks about the gentle nature of this cat and how it needs the companionship of humans much more than other breeds and how easily a Birman can get its feelings hurt and even pout. Grooming tips are given on how to take care of the thick yet fine coat of the Birman. I've found it to be the best book on cat care out there for the Birman and I highly recommend it."
214,"Wonderful! Karen Cummings writes a book that tells you all the basics in cat care and tailors it to the Birman breed. The excellent photographs enable the reader to see what a Birmans really looks like. The history of the Birman, (Sacred cat of Burma), it's mythic legend is beautifully illustrated in the artworks that appear on page three and on seven, &quot;Mandela Cat&quot; and &quot;Temple of the Sacred Cat&quot;. I am the artist of these artworks and I am very impressed with the excellent reproductions produced by the publisher. In addition, as a Birman, breeders for over 15 years I can and do highly recommend this book."

217,"Tess was washed ashore on the Isle of May during a terrible storm eleven years ago, presumed to be the only survivor of a shipwreck. Just six years old at the time, Tess had buried horrible memories deep within her, and remembered little of what brought her to the island. An elderly couple living on the island raised her and taught her to be self-sufficient. But now they are dead, and Tess is all alone on the island. She longs for human companionship but has learned to fear the world beyond the Isle of May. When a young Highlander washes ashore in a storm, Tess feels compelled to save him. At twenty years of age, Colin Macpherson is the youngest son of a Highland laird. He's been restlessly roaming the seas, but when he washes up on Tess's island, everything changes. As Colin helps Tess remember her past, he finds himself drawn to her as he's never been drawn to a woman before. And Tess is discovering strong feelings for him as well, feelings that may very well be love. But when they return to the mainland in search of Tess's heritage, will they be able to stay together, or will they be torn apart?Set in Scotland in 1543, this is my new favorite book in the Avon True Romance series. The love story between Tess and Colin was so romantic and incredibly sweet, and I LOVED the setting. If you are a fan of the Avon True Romance series, or like historical romances for teens, this book is a must-read."
218,"After enjoying a previous Avon True Romance, Gwyneth and the Thief, I decided to read more from the series. I thought Gwyneth was great, but this is even better yet. Tess is a seventeen-year-old who lives on the Isle of May. She was taken under the care of a couple who oversaw the island, but they have died, and she is completely alone. One day, she finds that a young man is washed ashore, and drags him from the water. She does not want to be near him, as she was warned to stay away from all men, so she hides on the island. Colin Macpherson, a highlander, searches for the young lady who rescued him. Tess is stubborn, but eventually they get to know one another. Tess does not know much about her past, with the exception of nightmares which give small recollections. Colin realizes that Tess is part of the Lindsay clan, and when a ship comes to rescue him from the island, Tess goes with him, in order to find the life she was taken away from eleven years ago. Will she be able to have peace, and be with Colin, the person she has grown to love? Read this very interesting novel to find out. I really enjoyed reading this. Many congratulations to May McGoldrick on writing such a great novel!"
219,"This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels."
220,"This book was a perfect historical romance for teens! It is set in Scotland in the 1500s. Tess has lived on a desolate island ever since she was a little girl, raised by its caretakers who are now dead, leaving 17-year-old Tess alone. She is rescued by Colin MacPherson, a handsome young Highlander, who takes her back to the mainland. He tries to help her find her heritage, but the two end up falling in love. This book was the best Avon True Romance, it was just soooo sweet and romantic and I loved the Scottish Medieval setting."
221,"I loved everything about this book - the setting, the characters, and the romance. The love story between Tess and Colin was really sweet and I loved the Medieval Scottish setting of the 1500s. I highly recommend this to teens who love historical romances!"
222,"This book was spellbinding! Filled with adventure, romance and sort of a murder mystery. I couldn't put it down!I wish more of the guys were like Colin!!!!!! Except I wasn't to fond of the hair that's like longer than mine ......"
223,"Tess Lindsey has lived on the remote island of Isle of May and has been raised by the only two other people who lived on the island, all the time uncertain of who she is and her true identity. After the death of her caretakers, she is left on the island all by herself and must do battle alone. That is until one day she rescues a stranger---a stranger who also holds her questions of her past in his very hands. Colin MacPherson has the knack for adventure and a beautiful girl at every single place he visits, that is until he meets Tess...a strong-willed girl that intrigues him at every turn. As the two form a bonding trust Colin begins to piece together the clues of Tess's mysterious past...and a future that most likely will not include him. This definitely has to be one of the best Avon True Romances so far, after Anna and the Duke. I didn't expect it to be this good so it really took me by surprise. Every teenage girl who loves romance should read this book!"
224,"When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series."
225,"If you're looking for a deep read, this is not the book. However, if you want to sit down and speed through a happy, cutesy romance novel than this book fits you perfectly. I enjoyed reading it and re-reading it. Every once and awhile a little light book is good for the mind set of a reader."
226,"This is such a wonderful addition to the series... I love the passion that is expressed, and the mystery of Tess' past that is revealed as you read... I challenge any who say this is not a good book."
227,"I really liked this one. I admit I had a little bit of a hard time getting into it a first. I have enjoyed all of the Avon true romance books, but the covers don't do much to promote themselves."
228,"The plot and outline was good, just the writing needed a bit of work. Things were repeated over and over through out the story and became redundant. Talk of children playing with dogs and such. Also there wasn't a good transition in Tess's attitude. She is weepy and scared, but when she gets there she is couragous, makes a speech and confronts a steward? This was okay, but other Avon True Romance books are better. Nicola and the Viscount, and Anna and the Duke being my favorites."
229,"I'm not a teenager, but I appreciate the well-written (and clean) romance! This is a great addition to the series, and one of my favorites :)"
230,"Tess is alone. For eleven years, an elderly couple raised her after finding her at six, alone and frightened, amongst the rocks on the shoreline of the island they keep. Now, though, Tess' guardians have died, leaving Tess to tend to the island and, as per their orders, hide whenever someone new comes there. When she finds a handsome young Highlander washed up on the shores of her island, she knows she must help him or he will die.As Tess and the handsome Highlander, Colin, spend time together waiting for a ship to come take him home, they form a friendship and discover that Tess is not so alone in the world as she thinks.This was a cute story, and definitely better than the last Avon True Romance (for teens) I picked up. It's the type of thing I would have swooned over as a teenager, had I deigned to read romances at that age (I admit, I had a bit of book snobbery going on, though I secretly loved any romance I could find in books I read). As an adult, now, I read the book and think it's cute. I would have loved to have seen how Tess and Colin's relationship matures as they do, but that is beyond the scope of this book and the age range it is intended for. I will probably be searching out McGoldrick's adult romance novels, though, given the promise this one held."
231,"Tess Lindsay has spent most of her life on an island of the Highlands. When Colin MacPherson ends up shipwrecked there, it starts to get interesting. She tells him all she remembers about herself and her old life. Finally she takes out a token, what she clenching when she arrived on the island, he realizes who she really is. An heir to the Lindsay clan in the highlands, for she is Theresa Catherine Lindsay. Her mother was a lowlander and her father was murdered. When they arrive they find out that her father's murderer, is after Tess still. She see's the face of him and when she visits her mother she sees him again. Colin follows her there to protect her but wonders if he will ever see her again. Will he? What will happen with the murderer see's Tess? Read the book to find out."
232,"In my opinion Tess and the Highlander is a romantic construction. There is conflict, courage and loyalty in this novel. It is tremendously readable and has unforgettable characters."
233,"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
234,"This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
235,"While I am still in the process of learning the Yoruba language, I think that this book is a nice beginners tool. Please keep in mind that the new book comes with to audio CD's that are MUCH NEEDED! So if you're considering buying the book used, fine, but be sure to ask if the CD's come with.Without the audio assistance, I'm not sure how great of a tool this will be in your journey to learn the beautiful language of Yoruba!Best,S"
236,"This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as ""teacher"" but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first, they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book, which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher, though. All in all, it's a great set and, if mastered, can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator, who speaks English to announce the lessons, is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead!"
237,"I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills."
238,"I recommend this book highly. I have a competitor's text also and while it is useful, I appreciate the format of Beginner's Yoruba which is interactive. The companion CDs that come with this book are simply outstanding. I especially enjoy the fact that the book is respectful of ALL religions.As an update after using the CDs for a few weeks, it is true that the speaker who speaks fastest on the CD does make many mistakes. I noted errors on greetings. These are rather odd to say the least. However, I still think this is a great source! My toddler is learning right along with me and she demands I play the CD everyday! As we repeat phrases, I simply correct the errors. I really appreciate the different participants on the CD and the dialogues which are authentic and properly contextualize the vocabulary.The phrase ""O'ngbiyanju"" is priceless!"
239,"This is not the first book I've read that is critical of psychiatry. But compared to Caplan, Breggin, and Szasz, this is the most sensible critique I've seen. Usually, in the anti-psychiatry literature one finds inexcusible nonsequiturs. For example: ""Psychiatrists often don't realize that the medication is causing the disorder (good point). Therefore, biological psychatry is unsound (bad point)."" Or ""Psychiatric illnesses are voted on by committee (good point), therefore there is no such thing as mental illness (bad point)."" Walker avoids making such obvious nonsequiturs. Far from being against biological psychiatry, Walker argues that current psychiatry is not biological enough. It appeals to highly hypothetical conditions (such as neurotransmitter disorders) while ignoring known conditions (such as pin worms or hypothyroidism). Some might think that this is all that Walker is saying, but his general point seems to be that since psychiatrists are taught to run through symptoms lists instead of being medical detectives, there a lot of unknown conditions which they are failing to discover."
240,"Dr. Walker's book is a stern indictment of the contemporary medical profession and the mental health field in particular. He charges the majority of psychiatrists of ignoring the true needs of their patients and instead practicing and arbitrary pseudo-science of labeling. They seem to have given up on the idea (fundamental to the philosophy of science)that all events have a cause and that to understand something we must understand the process of cause and effect that brought it into being. Most modern psychiatrists are not interested in finding out what is wrong through careful methodology. They are divided into two camps. The psychoanalytic types deny a medical cause for abnormal feelings and behaviour altogether (however, they still want the prestige that comes with being a medical doctor!). They look everything from a bad childhood to alien abductions to explain such things as psychosis and manic depression, even though no scientific study has ever proven the theories on which their claims are based. The next group, the standard issue biopsychiatrists are a little more up to date. They would admit the obvious scientific truth that someone who hears voices or is immobilized by a deep depression is psysically ill. However, they drop the ball as well. Most biologically based psychiatrists give very vague answers about the causes of mental illness, and rely on a few biological treatments which are tried on the patient almost randomly until one seems to &quot;work&quot;. For instance, a depressed person will be given one antidepressant drug after another without the doctor even stopping to consider that the deprssion may result from anemia, a thyroid imbalance, poor nutrition or a host of other causes. Many psyciatric patients today are not even given a blood test, an EEG or any other genuine medical test before traetment is prescribed. Walker points out that until people are given a battery of tests, we will never really know what is wrong with them. Prozac or tranquilizers may make the! m feel better temporatily, but they could be literally dying. He also attacks the concepts of hypochodndria and facetious disorder. For the most part, he argues, these are destructive labels used to protect doctors and stigmatized patients (&quot;if I can't figure out what is wrong with you then it is all in you're head and/or you are just making it up&quot;) While I don't agree with all his points (for instance, his extreme anti-prozac position) I must say that this book is must reading for anyone in need of mental health care."
241,"I was very impressed with A Dose of Sanity because so many books critical of psychiatry remind me of Breggin which claim that there is something &quot;spiritual&quot; missing in the patient, and the author ignores the bioligical problems inherent in the behavioral or mood disorder.However, I as I made my way through the book I was concerned that Dr. Walker was not going to address what to do if you have been diagnosed with a serious mood disorder, but were unable to find a physical cause (like a boy that was ADHD but had cardiac problems). I was right. He never said what to do if you have been diagnosed with manic depression (or any of the other hard to treat mood disorders). He did not address lithium or other non-antidepressant therapies for mood disorders. I agree that these treatments are probably only treating the symptoms of some underlying brain dysfunction that science has not yet named, but what does the patient do until science has figured this out? Remain psychotic? Lithium therapy may be some band-aid solution for a cellular dysfunction of our brain matter, but is a patient supposed to discontinue this medication because science can only offer this treatment to help the symptoms of the disorder? I wish Walker had offered an opinion and information on this issue.Also, along the same line, he didn't say what patients should do once they had gone through exstensive medical testing to determine their problem and nothing physically wrong was found. (Nevermind the fact that he did't give specific tests to ask for - just blood and urinalysis in addition to what else?) If you know that you don't suffer from pin worms, syphillis, typhus, cardiac problems or whatever else, but your symptoms only seem to match typical manic symptoms that only lithium helps, should you throw in the towel and accept the psychotropic medication?I do think that Dr. Walker is truly concerned about patients who have fallen victim to DSM &quot;diagnosis&quot;, and this book could be very helpful for a patient who has received psychiatric care, but did not have a full medical work-up before taking psychotropic medications. I only wish this book had touched on the issues that I mentioned above.Finally, the most important message of this book is never stop learning about what you have been told your disorder is, and never take the word of your doctor as law. As Walker says himself, there is no way that one doctor can know everthing about medicine."
242,"Walker's book rests on two main themes. One is that theDSM, in spite of its name, is not a diagnostic manual at all, but a catalogue of descriptive labels that serve as an excuse for abandoning further medical investigation. He calls the DSM ""a cookbook listing of symptoms that has replaced the science of differential diagnosis.""The other theme divides into two parts. The minor one is that many people who are slapped with DSM labels and prescribed psychotropic drugs have nothing at all medically wrong with them.The major theme, however, and the main theme of the book next to criticism of the DSM, is that almost all cases of serious aberrations of feelings or behavior stem from physical causes such as genetic disease, hormonal imbalances, toxins, infection, parasites, and tumors. The DSM encourages psychiatrists to be lazy and overlook these causes, he says. Psychotropic drugs only mask them, and do more harm than good. Psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, are totally useless for these conditions. Psychiatry should return to its true mission as practiced (according to Walker) by Emil Kraepelin and Benjamin Rush, namely to identify and treat the physical causes of insanity.I agree with Walker that cases of grossly aberrant behavior (as opposed to responses to stress) are probably due to unidentified physical causes. However, not identifying these causes is the failure of somatic medicine, not psychiatry. Psychiatry's mission has always been to sweep up after somatic medicine, and to sweep away society's rejects while it's at it.Walker maintains that there is a legitimate use of psychotropic drugs, but only in those extremely rare cases that the physical cause cannot be identified, or no curative treatment exists. My opposition to this contention is that far from being extremely rare, those are exactly all cases with which psychiatry deals. One of Walker's examples of physical disease which psychiatrists frequently fail to identify and treat is Tourette Syndrome, which he calls genetic. In spite of his own insistence that the causes of conditions should be scientifically sought, he fails to provide any evidence that TS is genetic in origin. Even if he had such evidence, since when does identifying conditions as genetic make them curable? On the other hand, Walker overlooks compelling evidence that TS is caused by brain damage: it is common in people whose brains have been damaged by psychotropic drugs. He doesn't mention how he thinks TS should be treated. In fact, the only ""treatment"" that exists, whether effective or not, is Haldol, the very type of treatment he claims to oppose except in those extremely rare cases, whichever they are.While correctly calling into question the efficacy and safety of psychiatric practice, Walker highly overrates somatic medicine. He attaches great diagnostic significance to gene mapping and brain scanning, whereas in reality such toys have as yet benefited no one but the doctors who employ them for research.One of Walker's more bombastic claims for successful treatment of aberrant behavior is ... surgically cleaning cholesterol out of a patient's brain arteries! (Who would be so gullible as to believe that?)Interesting to note are Walker's views on two of the greats among opponents to psychiatry, Peter Breggin and Thomas Szasz.Walker duly credits Breggin with having called attention to the horrific harm done by psychiatric drugs. Unfortunately, according to Walker (and I agree with him on this) the flip side to Breggin is blaming serious dysfunctional behavior on ""bad parenting."" No, not such obvious bad parenting as battering children or trading them for cocaine, but vague failures that only Breggin himself can identify, like paying insufficient attention to children. Walker might have added that those parents who are likely to seek psychiatric services, not to mention pay big bucks for them (a subject on which Breggin never touches), are the very parents who are deeply devoted to their children. Walker also criticizes Breggin for blaming schools, though schools are very much known to contribute to the ill-being of children.Contrary to his position on Breggin, Walker showers praise on Szasz, particularly for having been the first and the most relentless critic of DSM fake diagnoses. However, he feels Szasz goes too far in denying there is ever a physical origin for dysfunctional behavior, and by suggesting that such people are actually ""incompetent, lazy, or bad."" He presumes that Szasz would leave them to die in the streets and in jails, overlooking the fact that Szasz is the only writer in the field who has suggested a practical solution for dealing with such people, namely the non-medical asylum, or as Szasz nicknames it, the ""adult orphanage.""Those of you who are interested in ""alternative psychiatry"" may be interested in Walker's views on such treatments. He does not reject the idea outright, though he considers most of them quackery and downright silly. Acupuncture he calls effective in treating pain - but not curing the cause of pain.Orthomolecular medicinecan treat nutritional deficiency, but nothing else, he says.Walker further criticizes judges' reliance on psychiatric expertise. He says nothing about it that Szasz hasn't said before him. He does not mention involuntary commitment anywhere in the book.Finally, Walker calls on us, potential psychiatric patients, to take responsibility for our own health care. That's fine advice, but limited by the fact that responsibility can be carried out only in freedom. Massive state intervention in medicine means that much of his otherwise excellent advice is impossible to follow.All in all, this book's power is the author's ability to state in layman's language why theDSMis a fraud.Copyright MeTZelf"
243,"Dr.Walker has written a unique,and compassionate book. It has,indeed,saved my sanity! Dr.Walker's treats his patients with tremendous sensitivity,and,with a non-judgemental insight,far beyond any other doctor that I know! I think,and believe,that Dr.Walker is a medical giant,of our time."
244,"This book should be required reading by all psychiatrists. There is still so much to learn from this maverick psychiatrist. Dr.Sydney Walker 111 was an unforgettable and unique and towering giant,we will not find another Dr.Sydney Walker again!! The closest thing to another Dr.Walker in Canada might be the ill-fated Dr.Ed Pakes,a brilliant pioneer bereavement psychiatrist. There is also Dr.Robin Brooks-Hill. Then there is an aloof South African &quot;Shrink&quot;,and his son,who wrote some book called &quot;Freud&quot;. (Obviously that isn't really the correct title,but it is a free country) Besides,why see Dr.Aloof Shrink when you can watch Meryl Streep films on Video. Bouchard is no longer a power,Richler is dead,Where is Trudeau or Lon Chaney Jr when we need him?"
245,"King James: Believe the Hype, The LeBron James Story by Ryan Jones was a great bookto read it tells you about LeBron James early life and about his high school games andwhen he goes into the NBA . He was born in Akron, Ohio on December 30, 1984.He was mostly raised by his mother, LeBron went to school at St. Vincent-St. MaryHigh School . He was the starting point guard . James averaged 18.2 points and 6rebounds per game.Lebron James was also a star football player in addition tobasketball, LeBron was also First-Team All-Stateas a wide receiver for his high schoolteam. But, he didn't want to get hurt so he quit football and concentrated on playingBasketball . In his junior year, he appeared on the cover of SLAM Magazine whichshow everybody in the world who he was.In the NBA LeBron join the ClevelandCavaliers they made many changes to there lineup , adding Larry Hughes ,Damon Jones and Donyell Marshall and many more . Now LeBrons James is Standing at6 feet,8 inches and is 21 years old. That some information about what the book tells youabout. This was a great book and if you love basketball you should get this book."
246,"Came just like the buyer said, like new. had a pretty big fold in the back, but im not expecting flawless on a used book. exactly what i thought so A+. Perfect ship and got so fast."
247,This book is a very interesting one. The book describes how a young basketball star goes through his career from 8th grade to senior year in high school. The book shows Lebron's stuggles and accomplishments. It explains major deals with shoe companies. The book gives highlights from his most hyped high school games. The book shows all aspects of how Lebron made everyone believe the hype. Overall it was a good book and it is for anyone who loves reading about sports and athletes accomplishments.
248,"Ryan Jones is a great basketball writer. In King James: The LeBron James Story he does a great job of trying to show the reader how amazingly good LeBron James is at basketball. Coach Bob Gibbons said about LeBron's performance in the Olympic trials, ""I don't want to blow too much smoke and distort the kid's thinking, but I saw Kobe Bryant in tenth and eleventh grades, and I think this kid is more advanced than Kobe was."" Like LeBron, Kobe Bryant was drafted out of high school and has led the Los Angeles Lakers to multiple NBA Championships.Ryan Jones is editor-in-chief at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine that combined the sport with hip hop culture at a time when the genre was becoming increasingly popular. The magazine carries advertising for basketball-related products, street-wear clothing and hip hop music, and it has been credited with helping to market hip hop culture and basketball as one. It is only fitting that Ryan Jones wrote his first national magazine feature on LeBron James. He thoroughly explains LeBron's involvement with SLAM magazine throughout the book. He lives in New York with his wife and son.Although Jones seems a bit repetitive at times, his knowledge of basketball and great style shines though and creates an easy to read biography. In Chaper Four, he talks about the potential LeBron possessed in football as well as basketball: even though ""there wasn't much national buzz on LeBron the football player, area football coaches knew better."" Jones even compares him to the New England Patriots Pro-Bowl wideout, Randy Moss. While he mainly focuses on LeBron's basketball ability, his information about LeBron's high school football career is refreshing.With all the hype about LeBron and his constant coverage on ESPN, this book reveals the truth about LeBron and his journey from moving in with his friend's family to his 90 million dollar sneaker deal with Nike. While the vocabulary can be a bit easy at times, the book a joy to read, especially if you are a total sports nut like myself. A stong strength of Jones is to tell the complete story of every little event in Lebron's life. His very descriptive writing explains aspects of basketball that makes this book a good pick for sports lovers and non sports lovers alike. I give this book an eight out of ten and recommend it highly."
249,"I haven't read this book, but dont stop reading just yet. To all of you who have been living in ignorance for the past few years, I'd like to open ur eyes to a little magazine known as SLAM. 3 words: OF THA HOOK (please excuse my language - just trying to talk the talk)But seriously, no matter how die-hard of a ball fan you are, this is essential reading. Ryan Jones writes for the mag."
250,"My story is about LeBron James and how he grew up. When he was a freshman in high school he won tournament MVP for the state, which is amazing.The beginning starts at his childhood and continues so on. My favorite part in the book is when he's a freshman and he played football. Their team made it to state. They lost in the finals, but he got All State. That means hes one of the best in the state. Later that year he made the basketball team. They made it to the state finals. They won and LeBron got MVP. That happened for the next three years.Ryan Jones is a senior editor at SLAM, the monthly basketball magazine. He lives in New York. I would recommend this book to sports fans that like LeBron James. The age and gender I would recommend this book to is ages 13-35 and boys."
251,"This was a very cool book. It had a ton of great inside stuff I didn't know about The Man. The sneaker stuff was really interesting. Clearly LeBron was under enormous pressure to perform and to do the right thing, and even with the scounts and everything esle going on he gave 100% to his high school team, The Irish. Jones does a great job taking us inside the making of a star."
252,This was a AWESOME book. It really looks into the real life of LEBRON JAMES and shows you his trip into stardom. This book is great if you like watching basketball careers grow because is probably the most popular young basketball players in the world today and this book did a really good job of showing how LEBRON is always improving his game. I have read a ton of sports autiobiographies and this one was probably the most inspiring because it took an indept look at the personal and also basketball part of LEBRON JAMES life.
253,King James by Ryan Jones is a biography of Lebron's James' life prior to going into the NBA. It tells about how a little kid who lived in poverty with his mother goes on to become a six foot eight inch 245 pound high school basketball superstar. Lebron has to deal with the pressure of the media and go against tough opponents almost every game. Somehow he is able to handle all of this and all the other obstacles in his life. This is an entertaining book to read and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of Lebron James or is interested in reading about the rising star. The author does a great job of telling how Lebron is on and off the court. After reading this book you will come to respect Lebron as a basketbal player and a person.
254,"I first heard about Lebron when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and followed him ever since. I thought I read a lot about him, but reading this book told me so much that I had never known about Lebron as a player, a person, and all the hype and attention he got from the media, the shoe companies and everyone else. The fact that he dealt with so many distractions and people hating on him and still succeeded was really inspirational. This book has tons of info and quotes from Lebron, and it shows that he seems like a cool guy, too. I would definitely recommend this book if you're a fan of Lebron or just a fan of basketball and sports in general."
255,"LeBron James is a basketball hero. He has a big story on how he got to the NBA. LeBron was very poor growing up; his father left him and his mother when he was young. LeBron had to live with friends so his mom could work to keep a roof over their heads. A cool thing I thought LeBron did is when he was signing autographs an adult pushed over a kid just to get LeBrons signature but LeBron said ""Let me sign the kids first"". I think this shows LeBrons care for kids.When LeBron was in High School at St.Vincent St.Mary, the spotlight was on him. LeBron took the Irish to the state championship all four years of High School. LeBron played Football and Basketball in High School. He could of gone to college to be a star Wide Receiver but he chose Basketball. LeBron won the Mr.Basketball in Ohio award all four years in High School. I loved this book because LeBron never gave up at what he wanted to accomplish. LeaBron is a great role model to young kids because he never gave up and told himself that he could do it. LeBron now is in the NBA and won the Rookie of the Year award.Written by Gerald P. Willamspoon"

257,"While this book captures the hip sensibilities of SLAM, it's objective is not to be cool. The objective was clearly to tell LeBron James story, and the author does so fluidly and intelligently. The only issue I had when it came out was if LeBron warranted an entire book. Given that he's spent the first three quarters of his rookie season proving he may have even be underrated, consider the book warranted. So, basketball fans, if you want to know the real LeBron James story before it gets changed or distorted by the corporations that are soon to be even more involved in his life, check out this book and you'll get all the background you need to be able to intelligently discuss the first superstar of the new millenium."
258,"This was quite an enjoyable read. I was fascinated by the rise and rise of this basketball prodigy due to all the hype surrounding him. There is no doubt that Lebron James is one hell of a talent after seeing many of his highlight plays on T.V, and on the net. This book details his performances in school for ST Vincent-ST Mary and other events, the frenzied interest from fans and media wanting to see him perform, sport commentators and coaches raving about him being the best thing in the sport of basketball, hummergate, speculation about his future career plans, and the fight for his feet between Adidas and Nike in which the latter won because the former could not offer huge amounts of money in the bidding war with its major rival. Great stuff."
259,"I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans."

272,I have somewhere over a dozen titles on timber frame construction. This is the one I keep referring back to when it comes to my own construction plans. It is not written as a commercial for the next timber frame workshop as many of these books are. It shows several different building and roof styles rather than a single one. Good detail on joints and joinery as well as planning figures are included. All in all this book is excellent reference material for someone actually wishing to build.
273,This book talks about many of the important aspects of classic timber framing. The book was easy to use and will continue to be used as a reference when building the timber frame house. Very well put together and very knowledgable author.
274,My husband loves this book. He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by.
275,This book has been completely instrumental in guiding my husband in his timberframing pursuits. He has read it so much the cover and binding have fallen off and broken! But he holds on to it because it's the BEST reference for a DIYer to look to when starting your structure.
276,Classic book with lots of joints and explanations for both the beginning and accomplished timberframer to use as a reference. One of the top 10 books to have in your timberframing library.
277,"Dated (1980's) so don't expect a lot of current technology for this ancient craft. A pretty good read and part of my collection. This book is also co-authored by Sobon. Of the three (Build a Classic Timber-Framed House, Timber Frame Construction: All About Post-and-Beam Building and this one), you need this one the least. Interesting history but not so much on the construction aspect."
278,this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building
279,My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy.
280,This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.
281,"My wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide. Although we have construction skills, this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process. We can't wait to build another. We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house."
282,"Timber framing is my hobby, and I own several books on the subject, but this has always been my favorite. The how-to section is very thorough, and includes information on tools and techniques. The author's enthusiasm for the subject is what really makes the difference, though. The sections on history and woodworking are especially good. If a friend wanted to try timber framing, and asked me which book to buy first, I would pick this one without hesitation."
283,"This book is one of the classics on Timber Framing for those who want to get into this type of construction or build their own house. It is a very easy read. Though sometimes the author tends towards to much philosophy about life, construction and wood working.This book has very useful sections on joinery, design, raising, engineering, load physics, etc. Very easy to understand even if, like me, you are not a professional carpenter, contractor or mechanical engineer. I know nothing of contracting or building and understood the whole book.The book does not mention anything about Scribe Rule and Square Rule techniques and the differences between the two. These old techniques may not have been widely known when this book was written, although they were well known by early timber frame carpenters, before Timber Framing was replaced with cheaper, but faster Balloon Framing.A book that does go into Square Rule in a more structured way and is equally easy to read is Buid a Classic Timber-Framed House, by Jack Sobon."
284,"I have read all the major timber frame books on the market, including both titles from Jack Sobon. Benson's book is packed with information on how to build a timber frame and has an index in the back that allows one to figure out what size timber is needed. This book is one of, if not, the best on this subject."
285,"The details on this are excellent. Sketches, plans, perspectives, maths, tables, formulas, theory, you have it all. All graphics hand-drawn! Each joint has a photo, a drawing and cutting details and dimensions. Focused too: nothing outside the scope of the *classic* timber frame."
286,"This book was first written in 1980, though the philosophies presented between its covers are appropriate in these recent years of speculative energy prices and wobbling economic foundations. Timber frame house construction was ""green"" before that word was media-masticated and spit into popular culture.The book is well illustrated and instructive, and it is also well written. The authors have both experience and passion for this topic. The hand-drawn illustrations are well labeled with a drafting font that makes it interesting and captivating to read.The book begins with a historical review of this art, and slowly drills down to detailed diagrams of the many joining techniques. It is amazing that this old style of construction intuitively solved problems in structural mechanics without the need for finite element modeling, or even nails for that matter. The strength of this method of construction comes not from the size of the timbers (though they are substantial), but from the joints crafted from wood with axes, augers, and hammers. Timber framing is like cabinet building, but bigger.There are many detailed drawings of joining techniques, and the reader quickly realizes that the craftsmanship and careful execution of these joints is the secret to this respected building trade. Flipping through these pages also immediately reveals the compromises that are made in modern home construction. Those who have ever wondered where the term ""stick built"" comes from will find the answer in this book. Dimensional lumber are sticks in comparison to timbers. Though metal connectors used in today's framing have done wonders for total structural stability, this book shows you that timber framing negates the need for stamped steel reinforcement.Timber framed structures are built for permanence, preserving the strength of the frame by encasing it completely within the outer sheathing and exploiting the timbers as an aesthetic interior design element. It is amazing that so many barns and houses were built only by hand, because a single timber required two or more men to lift and transport. In this age, a crane is more appropriate. One should keep this in mind if considering this project on his or her own.The captions in the book are terse and straight forward. ""Wood never lies to you."" ""You don't just hack away obliviously."" As said before, the writing is eloquent, and one can feel the earnestness of the writer with every paragraph. This excerpt sounds like it was written this year, rather than 1980:""To insulate as well as we can and to make houses as tight as we can present new challenges to the building industry. Houses will no longer naturally ventilate because of our inability to get them tight. We can lock them up like thermos bottles if we like. To bring new air into the house, we'll have to design ventilation systems into the plans. With heat loss cut to the bones, we'll have to design natural and mechanical recirculation to keep the temperature even and the air fresh. In this kind of environment, the heat from appliances, lights, and even body heat will contribute significant proportions to the small heating requirements. In houses built this way, energy from the sun, wind, or water could easily replace fuel-fired power sources.""""Energy conservation is the hope of the future. In conscience, we must mark the end of the era of substandard housing that is cheap to build but expensive and wasteful to maintain. In conscience, we should begin a time when houses contain energy-autonomous environments that consume no fossil fuels and are build to last centuries.""Those words are nearly three decades old. They are describing what is sometimes called a ""passivhaus"" or ""passive house"", which is also an established building technique but is only recently seeing revival as a ""green"" building technique. Insulation, rather than expensive heating and cooling systems, is the key to energy efficiency. What the authors are showing is that with a timber frame, the outer skin can be insulated panels that are tightly sealed, making a water tight and nearly air tight structure that is stronger, more permanent, and more energy efficient than any home constructed from dimensional lumber.And if there is any gripe of the book, it is that there should be more detail on the outer sheathing and insulating techniques, as well as wiring methods. There are a few cross sections (fairly detailed) but they are not as comprehensive as other sections of the book. Perhaps in 1980 the insulated panel industry was not large enough to devote more than a few pages to it. But now, there are composite, structurally insulated panels of many varying types that can be used in conjunction with a timber frame to build a very efficient, very strong, and architecturally pleasing home. And this is yet another example of how things come full circle; one of the oldest building techniques proves itself to be superior to its modern replacement in multiple ways.On a personal note my building experience comes from the construction of a stick built garage which, at the time, seemed incredibly stout to me. I used 2x6 lumber for the walls rather than 2x4s, and sheathed the walls and roof with 5/8"" oriented strand board. I used metal connectors in liberal amounts, reinforced the joints and ceiling joists, and insulated the entire structure so that I could work during the cold months. The garage is a solid, well insulated structure that maintains a comfortable climate by insulation and thermal mass alone. I was striving for a better way of building, and after reading this book I see that my desire was for timber frame construction. I wish I would have known more about it when I undertook the garage project, but now if I ever build my own home, I know how I will build it.Lastly, the appendix has diagrams for beam loads that is nearly more comprehensive than some textbooks on the topic of strength of materials. Even if you do not intend to build a home this way, this book may still be of value to you if you have any interest in building, construction, or architecture.For more information on finishing a timber frame home with different structural insulated panel technologies, see Benson's newer book: The Timber-Frame Home: Design Construction Finishing. It has more color photos and addresses the special considerations for foundations, plumbing, wiring, and insulating timber frame homes."
287,"This is a fantastic book. I purchased it for my husband, who is a very accomplished wood-worker. After spending a winter studying it we have spent the summer raising our timber frame addition."
288,"Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book."
289,"If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project."
290,This is the fourth book on timber framing that I've read. some content is covered in the other books but there is still some very valuable information that I have not seen until reading this book. I am planning on building a Timber Frame and this book has answered a lot of questions that some other well recommended books did not.
291,"Amazing to learn that every Jaquith that you have ever met has descended from a single ancestor (Abraham Jaquith) who emigrated to the US in the 1600's as a Huggenot. Numerous Jaquith ancestors were patriots who fought and died for this country from the King Philip's War on. The only reason I did not give this family biography a 5 star rating is because some of the historical data in the living members of the Jaquith family is not correct. The older the records, the more correct the data is."
292,"Modern day Snow White (who also happens to be a lottory winner) finds herself in a cabin -- that's later inhabited by eight men (the elves) who were out fishing when she arrived. There is one particular elf that makes snow white's toes curl...This book will make you smile, laugh and touch your heart!"
293,"While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works."
294,"The book offers a good overview of the subject of woodburning. The types of tools needed are discussed; however, it was short on explanation here. The author should have spent more time examining the different types of tools and the qualities of each type. The book discusses the best types of wood for pyrographic efforts and this was useful. The book has a wide variety of designs from birds to seashore items. All are well drawn. The disigns are complex, and they are printed in the book very lightly. The problem in reproducing them comes from the lightness of the picture and the complex design. They do not reproduce as well as disigns I have found in other books.Overall I found the book informative and the designs excellent."
295,"Until today I had never heard of Norma Gregory, But like a lot of pyro artist pyrography came way after being an artist.In my 40's I decided to learn pyrography,I've done it for ten years now and as much as I love doing this type of art I found it harder to find new subjects Until I picked up this book. Page after page the Author lets the reader see so many Designs and Ideas. I'm not a writer,and I've never done a review. But I do know enough that this is a great book for beginers or Pyrographers who have been at it awhile. William Hough"
296,"Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book."
297,Love this book. Lots of patterns and instructions. Can't wait to start woodburning projects. Borders and patterns are just lovely!!!
298,my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her
299,I like it OK it is sure worth having as an extra reference in pyrography. I would think any new artist in pyrography would like it as an addition to their collection
300,"This had some nice designs, but a little advanced for who I bought it for. He will have to grow into using it"
301,this is a good book for more of the advanced pyrographer rather than the beginner the designs are really great though
302,"An interesting early book by the great historian of ideas JGA Pocock. This book focuses on what Pocock calls the history of historiography in 17th century England. Pocock is concerned mainly with reconstructing how 17th century intellectuals thought about their past. This apparently recondite topic turns to have a number of interesting dimensions. Pocock begins with a surprising and interesting fact, that something prefiguring historical analysis emerged from the study of legal traditions. This occurred first in 16th century France, where the emerging methods of humanist textual criticism were applied to legal traditions. The existence of different legal traditions in France led several scholars to discover the dynamic quality of legal history, the discovery of feudalism, and reconstruction of legal history in the context of a form of social history. In England, where the common law tradition had no competitors, the evolution of knowledge followed a different course. The common lawyers, epitomized by the great Edward Coke, projected the common law and contemporary English political institutions back into an immemorial past as a permanent feature of English life. This treatment of English legal history was entangled in efforts to resist James I assertions of royal power.Subsequent scholars, notably the great antiquarian Henry Spelman, partly inspired by French scholars, subsequently discovered the changing nature of English law, discovered feudal law, and made inferences from legal history to imaginative and insightful reconstructions of medieval English society. Pocock evinces particular symppathy for Spelman's efforts to elucidate non-anachronistic understandings of key terms and concepts, an activity very similar to Pocock's own scholarly goals. Pocock traces the influence of Spelman's discoveries on subsequent scholars and how these reconstructions of English history were entangled in 17th century politics. This book concludes with a nice chaper on the treatment of English history following the Glorious Revolution, describing the emergence of the Whig version of English history and looking forward to the work of important 18th century historians like Robertson and Hume.Like of all of Pocock's work, this book is characterized by close analysis of the texts, Pocock's impressive erudition, and clear writing."
303,"I've read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all through out the book"
304,"Thanks to my grandparents, who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century, I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents, I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history, but in most of them, whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool, but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories, I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland, Chinese-Americans in China, and so on, but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer, Shalom Aleichem, Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So, obviously, my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories, by a Nobel Prize winner, will stay with you for a long time. The strange, sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life, bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places, while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic, religion, animals, thieves, rabbis, prostitutes, mystics, Holocaust survivors, Talmudic scholars, prisoners, books, butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story, you find pathos and tragedy, happiness and satisfaction, tensions and transformations. Two of the stories, ""The Seance"" and ""The Letter Writer"" must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer, this is an excellent book to start with. If you have, you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form."
305,"Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker, Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories, which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories, where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool, Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad, funny, ironic, poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about!"
306,"&#34;The Seance&#34; is a collection of short stories. It portrays the lives of Jewish characters in Eastern Europe between the wars.I found the book a little hard to read. Singer paints his characters so clearly, you can actually smell them. That is sometimes too hard to take. I saw my grandmother in his pictures and it wasn't to pleasant."
307,"THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES is a collection by Isaac Bashevis Singer first published in 1968. Singer wrote primarily in Yiddish, and the 16 short stories here have been translated into English by various translators, though overseen by the author.Singer's stories are invariably set among Jewish communities, the majority in the Polish Jewish villages of the late Russian Empire, though three are set in the postwar United States. Readers of this collection should have a basic knowledge of Jewish customs, for example, what a mezzuzah is. Still, behind the trappings of culture, the characters are universal and anyone will recognize themselves and their acquaintances here. At times, however, Singer is more interested in allegory than realism, and the characters represent the Jewish people. Singer's depiction of Polish Jewish life is not a nostalgic reminisce of some purer age, and the frankness of Singer's themes is remarkable. The subject of ""Yanda"" is a provincial prostitute, while ""Zeitl and Rickel"" describes the doomed lesbian romance of two pious girls.Found by chance in a ""take a book, leave a book"" pile, THE S&Eacute;ANCE AND OTHER STORIES was my introduction to this Nobel laureate. While I'm not so bowled over by the stories to want to seek out other works by this author, the material is consistently entertaining (the 200 pages are a quick read) and some of the endings memorable."
308,"This not a &quot;how to&quot; guide to &quot;swinging&quot; (or whatever people call it) but in fact much more a book that addresses the question of being together and growing with a partner while retaining individuality and seperatedness within a relationship of honesty, trust and openess. I felt a lot less cynical and much more positive about the institution of marriage as a result of reading this book.I thought it was excellent and I feel it's a book that would probably appeal to many more people if the title was different. But then again it was because of the title that I found it. Highly recommended for any relationship whether or not marriage is a part of it."
309,I feel that this book can apply to every romantic pairing. This is not just a book for those contemplating an open marriage. This is a book that can give you great ideas regarding space in a relationship. It expands on the idea that just because you are part of a couple does not mean you have to give up yourself. It promotes the idea of still mainting and developing new ideas and hobbies about yourself. It really has so very little to do with sex and more to do with keeping your own life exciting and not expecting the marriage to solve all your fulfilment needs.
310,"The title of this book has become misleading only because the meaning of the words ""Open Marriage"" has changed over the decades.This book is an excellent guide for people interested in all the aspects of attaining and living in an open marriage, which is an overall way of life, not just sexual freedom. Everything from sex to doing the dishes is covered in this book. Some of the language may sound dated since it's original printing, but then again, so does Shakespeare.This the best book I have ever found to learn about ALL aspects of your marital relationships (not just the sexual ones) and discover the ways in which people try to control and eventually destroy each other as individuals within a marriage.If you want a book on ""swinging"" (a/k/a recreational, non-monogomous sex) then this is NOT the book you are looking for. But then again, Open Marriage is leaps and bounds beyond just swinging. This book guides you through making this a way of life in a wonderful way, changing the traditional marriage views in ALL aspects, including non-monogomous sex, but not JUST sex.How do I know this? I've been living this way for 15 years and still going happy and strong. My first ""traditional"" marriage lasted 3 years."
311,"Please don't be confused by the unfortunate choice of title, nor by the ridiculous books promoting promiscuity that are associated with it by Amazon databases.Let's examine the two negative reviews of this book.One reviewer admits that he had decided the book wasn't worthwhile before reading it, and proceeds with an attitude that dares the authors to change his mind. This is hardly an ""open"" reading, is it? Further, the message of this book is in no way negated by a supposed divorce between the authors. The authors of Open Marriage specifically instruct readers to examine their expectation that marriage lasts forever.Another reviewer has a vested interest in dismissing Open Marriage, because its ideas contradict those of a book he wrote. He is careful to advertise his own book in his negative review of Open Marriage.As for whether Open Marriage is outdated, since when did such things as communication and trust become outdated? With extremes of ideology and dogma on a rapid increase, a book that promotes careful examination of our assumptions and expectations before getting married has never been more relevant. Has Socrates' dictum ""An unexamined life is not worth living"" ever gone out of date?Briefly, I'll quote from chapter 4:""The guidelines [to healthy relationships] are as follows:1 realistic expectations2 privacy3 open and honest communication4 flexibility in roles5 open companionship6 equality7 identity8 trustWhere do love, sex, and fidelity fit in? Are these not guidelines too - the basic components of any marriage? Important, yes; guidelines, no. Many of the problems with the closed marriage [defined by poor communication, lack of trust, immaturity etc.] stem from a false concept of the part that love, sex, and fidelity play in the relationship between man and a woman. The guidelines of open marriage listed above form the basis upon which love, sex, and fidelity achieve their meaning, not vice versa. If personal identity is based on love, equality measured by sex, and trust defined by fidelity, then identity will be crushed by a lessening of the initial romantic fervor, equality diminished by a temporary failure in sex, and trust destroyed through even the appearance of infidelity. But if personal identity, equality and trust exist in full measure, then the normal fluctuations that occur in any relationship between two human beings can be taken in stride.""One way of looking at the book Open Marriage is to say that the authors are discussing which comes first, the chicken or the egg? They are revealing that love, sex, and fidelity are outcomes of mature relating, thus not the cause of mature relating. If we reverse causation and pursue the product directly, without the process, than we set in motion a degradation from expectation, to demands, to manipulation, to frustration, and ending in ""bitter disappointment"" (chapter 4). For example, suspicious jealousy pursues fidelity directly, bypassing the process of building trust and commitment. On the other hand, when we follow the above 8 principles of healthy relating, the likely outcome is love, and fidelity. I recall a TV Sitcom in which a holiday family reunion wasn't going well, and someone angrily threatened that ""we all had better start having fun right now!"" Again, pursuit of the outcome directly without the process, results in our realizing the very thing we most fear (can you hear echoes of Dr. Phil McGraw in this?)The authors are saying that an unexamined marriage will fail because our unconscious assumptions, demands, and expectations are going to take over, and a great deal of negative conflict will result. These authors are simply saying that we need to pay attention and be proactive, examine our thoughts and feelings openly, and negotiate a mutually acceptable relationship. This open communication and cooperation, as opposed to conflict, is what the authors refer to in the title of their book. They are referring to a Socratic openness to challenging one`s own thoughts and behaviors as a basis of healthy living. This point is strongly supported by Dr. M. Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, who refers to Open Marriage on page 93 of ...Traveled. Dr. Peck's says the same thing with a different metaphor: we ought to examine our mental ""maps"" and be willing to revise them to keep ourselves dedicated to reality. Let Dr. Peck's reference carry more weight than mine."
312,"This book reached its ""sell before"" date about 25 years ago. Better books have been written, but haven't been hyped so thoroughly, so it keeps getting reprinted.The ""open marriage"" concept has -- REPEAT AFTER ME -- absolutely nothing to do with sexual nonmonogamy. Rather, the authors examine the problem of what another author has called ""the couple front,"" where couples feel they must act as if they're surgically joined, & end up feeling confined & eventually hating each other.If you are NOT interested in nonmonogamy, then read ANY book by Harville Hendrix & you'll find thoughts that are much more practical.If you ARE interested in nonmonogamy (group marriage, polyamory, etc.), then start with Intimate Friendships (Ramey), Polyamory (Ravenscroft -- whoops, that's me), Polyamory (Anapol), Honest Sex (Roy & Roy), or Group Marriage (Constantine & Constantine)... or even The New Faithful (Nearing), or Three in Love (Foster).I usually see ten copies of this book at any thrift store. That's somehow fitting."
313,"This book is a classic when it pertains to building and establishing a relationship that works for you and your partner. It is written with a much different perspective and definition of an open marriage than today's view of Open Marriage.I highly urge anyone in a relationship to read this book together with their partner as a way to stimulate and nurture individual and collective growth.Please keep in mind the time period this book was written in, as some of the examples used to illustrate points will not speak to the current dynamics between the sexes.Overall, it's a thoughtful and transforming read."
314,"The criticisms of this book are mostly about its non-monogamous aspect: the O'Neills (allegedly) broke up, therefore their relationship style is null and void. By this logic, is monogamy null and void, because monogamous people divorce? No type of relationship--straight, gay, monogamous, polyamorous, etc--is guaranteed against breakup. There are also horrendous relationships that are together forever because of desperation or beliefs. Even if there is a higher percentage of breakup in a certain relationship style, is ""together until death"" the only measure of a valid relationship?As many people pointed out, ""open marriage"" back then didn't mean specifically what it does now. In this book it means communicating openly, treating each other as equals, and allowing each other personal freedom. Most of this book is about how to get along better in a relationship by remembering that you both are individuals. You don't have to do everything together or have everything in common. You don't have to give up separate interests that your partner doesn't share. You don't have to give up friends when you get married. Giving up things like that don't make couples closer; they make couples resent each other and also take away their outside support systems.They mention non-monogamy as a possibility if both partners agree to it. They mention that depending on the context, sex with another person may not be the most horrible betrayal in a marriage (I said, depending on context. There are plenty of times it is a major betrayal.) Specifically I remember the passage about ""the grass is always greener"", and how with no fence, there is less of that feeling.My criticism of the ""love and sex without jealousy"" chapter is they talk about not having jealousy, but aren't very specific about how to deal with it and how to overcome it. (There are other books on open relationships that go into more detail about that.)Another criticism is that at times it relies on a premise of both people having careers that allow for economic independence. A career like that is not available to all people; there is no reason that only people with good careers should be able to have good relationships.There are lots of self-help books that promise a ""one and only way"" to have a satisfying relationship if you follow some off-the-wall advice, including the ""emotional infidelity"" variety that do advise couples to avoid friends and spend all of their time together. This book, in comparison, is common sense. Whether you want to be monogamous or non-monogamous, I think this book provides practical advice that should be elementary, but often isn't."
315,"The O'Neills' exciting, original approach to married life shows you and your mate how the stifling, limited arrangement you've always thought marriage had to be can be opened up into an honest, undemanding, joyful relationship. they'll introduce you to the OPEN MARRIAGE concepts-trust, liking, role flexibility, individual freedom and growth, and love and sex without jealousy-that can do wonders for your marriage. OPEN MARRIAGE must be read before you get married-or before your marriage gets a day older!~*~This book needs to modernized. I see there is a 1984 version, but I don't know how that fits in today's age. It is a dry read, but I pushed thru and did get a few ideas to allow my own marriage to grow and flourish."
316,"This book is still a classic. But, better today are the books on Polyamorous relationships."
317,"I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up."
318,The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day
319,"This is ground breaking work. It moves away from the abstract, dualistic ideas of God that are grounded in Greek philosophical and pagan concepts. T. F. Torrance describes in detail where these ideas originated from and how they often threatened the integrity of the gospel. The churches in the first few hundred years were forever challenged with concepts and ideas that had no grounding in Scripture and tradition. By contrasting Jesus Christ as the centre for all our understanding about who God is and what God does against false concepts, Torrance very effectively shows how the church today has lost this vital focus. I would consider this book to be a masterpiece in bringing the cosmic reality of the gospel in the person and work Jesus Christ to a shocking and utterly staggering degree. If you dare to read this book, be prepared to be radically changed forever!"
320,"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
321,"Early on in this story reader is informed that main character has a split personality. 3 girls are murdered and buried in back yard of Mary Barton, protagonist. Mary B. is sweet and loves her garden. Her other half is wicked to the max. The novel starts with her cussing like a sailor, wholly unlike sweet Mary B. The incredibly stupid atty. doesn't infer anything about the seeming two Mary's. Mary B. charged with murder that she obviously committed. Most of book contains court scenes that are well-written but are merely banal and static, the story stops. After conviction inevitable knife attack on atty by bad Mary, who we now learn is a twin of good Mary; at least that's the way the book reads. Within the reality of the book this is impossible and nonsense. But the reader is supposed to believe that good Mary has an evil twin who did the killings...I read the ending of the novel several times to see if it was communicating to the reader that the bad Mary was just the evil side of Mary B., i.e. she has a split personality. But, no, the book is saying that there are two Maries...not one with a good and bad side. If you want to read a lot of fairly interesting courtroom questioning by prosecutor and def. atty, most of the book is irrelevantly devoted to this, so read it and enjoy an O.J. moment. Perhaps the worst mystery/suspense novel I have ever read. This is my fourth and last McBain novel. HIs stories read at supersonic speed and purposefully divert the reader from thinking about the plot, characters, conflict,etc. Recommended solely for no-depth crowd of mystery readers (90% of readers are in this category; hence, the popularity ofjames patterson, Sue Grafton, Kellerman's,and many more; can anyone actually read Elizabeth George's prose and not become constipated and nauseous). Also, irrelevant romance between Mary's defense atty and female prosecutor. Added nothing to story, except perhaps to be a lame red herring that the femme fatale might have something to do with the murders."
322,"This book is quite touching. It tells Dorie's story of all the unbelievably horribe things she experience while growing up being abused both physially and sexually. It gives hope to those who believe that no one's situation is as bad as their's or those who think recovery is not possible. If you are looking for self help to enhance you own healing journey this book is probably not what you need if you dont fall into the above categories. However, it is a great testimony to be aware of."
323,"This is Dorie Van Stone's complete story - the sometimes graphic details that were left out of her book, ""Dorie, the Girl Nobody Loved"". This book gives hope to those who have been abused or who work with those who have. God had his hand on Dorie and brought her full circle to a place of healing where she is now ministering to others - an amazing true story!"
324,"My friend told me about this book and asked me to read it. This is a great testamony about what God can do to help people in the low place. Doris story realy touched my heart and it woke me up about how many people are sexyualy abuesd and what terrible exspirience this is. We, I and my friend wanted to do something about it. We wanted more people to heare Doris story, so they would be able to get some help if this had happend to them, so we transleted her book from english into Icelandic. I have heard that it helped many people here in Iceland to get healing from God after they read this book.Arni"
325,This book is unbelievably sad. I couldn't put it down. It opened my eyes to the child abuse going on in the world. It shows how God can make a difference in a life.
326,"I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!"
327,I had read this book when I checked it out from the library. After reading it I knew I wanted a copy for myself. It is an excellent book and I so appreciate the timeliness of my order.
328,"Another great book to keep in a library of counselor and clinical journals. Having an understanding of what a patient/client is referring to when they are coming to grips with sexual abuse is important to a provider of care and support. This is one of a set of books geared toward educating the person, the counselor, as well as the general public in the harms caused by sexual abuse, but it also highlights the resilency of the person who has gone through it."
329,"I read &quot;Trouble on Titan&quot; around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy &quot;Trouble on Titan.&quot;"
330,"Twelve years after the first review, and Cassini is there. It's Spring on Titan, and it's raining methane. Hydrocarbons are lying about on the surface, in pools larger than the great lakes. Just by dumb luck, the place turns out to be almost exactly how Nourse imagined it. What a piece of work is Man. Especially that one.I read it in 1960, and could see then that it's not really about sports-rockets (although there is a cool one). It's everything a ""juvenile"" could ever be, with a father-son rapprochement, East-is-East friendships that grow between opposite equals, first love, labor trouble, industrial sabotage, and a rebellion conspiracy. When I first read Heinlein later that year, I thought he suffered by comparison. I was eight at the time."
331,Voices heard on audio tape from a state seemingly from a realm beyond the dead. First heard by a dog with very keen hearing and them magnified by audio tapes so human ears could hear them. Very interesting.
332,"This book offers clear, concise information on the grants, fellowships, and contests that are available to writers. They have most of the listings marked with a letter code, such as J for Journalists, which makes skipping inappropriate entries a lot faster!"
333,"This book is invaluable. It provides contact information for countless sources of funding, it's easy to use, and the range of grants and awards is astounding. Writers of every discipline, and from every step of their career, I think, will find something suited to their needs."
334,"I bought this book a few weeks ago from the Pen American Center. I've found over 100 sources of funding that I qualify for right now and about 50 more that I qualify for later. I am really loving this book. It is designed in such a way that it's easy to scan all listings for ones that apply to you and easy to search for specific ones as well. In the back everything is indexed several ways, making things even easier to find.The information they provide you with is comprehensive and extensive. Kudos to the editor and researcher!If you're a writer, be it fiction, plays, journalistic, non-fiction, whatever, this book is a great resource for you."
335,What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's an invaluable resource for both published and non-published writers alike. The only complaint I have is that I would have liked to have seen a CN designation for &quot;Creative Non-Fiction.&quot;
336,"A bit outdated but full of very useful information, including writing contests, govt grants, overseas residencies, writers colonies and a few other programs.I found 6-12 very good items in this book and there were a choice of about 300 (i.e. about half are for magazine contests)."
337,"Dear Sirs: I'd like to make my brief sketch of my past career. Whe I was little,I used to make some performances even in my class at a elementary school,such as comical actions,reading a poem with the too-exagerated and help make attractiveness from other cute/smart girl classmates,althoug seemingly,I have only few memories for me to study homeworks after school,but I had stood top groups about the results of regular tests. I feel, I had turned my focuss upon studying when entering a top ranked high-school in Osaka,Japan, the excellent school;each classmates used to be a very brainy/smart with the background before, had a brilliant school histories. Those days,IQ TEST(mental ability test) had been available,and as far as my memory serves, in a few times,informed me of my scores from the teacher, I do not all of them,but a IQ Score of mine was 154 or such,just still in my memory.

338,"Whales in the dreams of children, whale spirituality, whale sex and whale governance are all things we'll not likely get from scientific researchers for decades, perhaps a century or two. That is one reason the new book by Mary Getten, a Naturalist specializing in the wildlife of the San Juan Islands and a practicing animal communicator is so brilliant. This is not for folks who think that actual communication with whales (or other critters) is impossible. Those folks are probably the same people who get angry at their dogs for not doing what they are told.Mary herself was once a skeptic, as she relates in ""Communicating with Orcas: The Whales' Perspective"". At her first animal communication workshop, facilitated by Penelope Smith, Mary was given the task to communicate with Pirouette, Penelope's cockatiel:""I knew nothing about birds. Mammals were my passion, and I had nointerest in delicate little avians. Truthfully, I was a little frightened of them, yet here I was face to face with a cockatiel and it was time for us to talk.I looked into her bright white face, admiring the crest of yellow feathers on her forehead and the orange dot on her cheek. Drinking in her features, I relaxed and thought, this won't be too tough. She seems nice enough. So I began to think about what to say to her.This is where it all went downhill. I didn't have a clue what to say to a bird. You would have though that I'd spent my entire life locked into a closet. Not a single question appeared. Time ticked by and I knew I had to so something, so I kept repeating: ""Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette. Hello Pirouette.""Finally, I stopped for a moment to think of something else to say, and clear as a bell I heard Pirouette say: ""Can't you say anything but hello?""Humor, backed with good science and historical tidbits going back to Aristotle and Pliny The Elder balance the presentation for those who are a little reticent to believe in this mode of communication. (This skepticism persists even in the wake of breakthrough research by famed scientist Rupert Sheldrake.) Mary's writing is clear and accessible and the stories of whale sex are quite funny. I mean laugh-out-loud, drool on the PAGE funny.Yet, the skepticism that Mary had when first learning to communicate with animals is the book's biggest weakness, in my view. I was fascinated by the notion of Ruffles, the male elder of the Southern Puget Sound resident community's J Pod, visiting the dreams of schoolchildren who had been on whale-watching cruises. The notion that our species, the lowly Homo sapiens, is at the beginning of a new wave of consciousness that will see remarkable innovations in bodies and senses, or that of the whale councils, the ability to live in past lives (though whales don't call them that) and their description of the universal life force as ""The Prime Cause,"" are all subjects that fascinate me, but the book only teases with these concepts. Perhaps a sequel is called for.However, these are pretty far-out concepts for the average reader and when it comes down to it, Mary has covered the basics in a thorough manner with a wicked wit. If you have the least bit of interest in Orcas, you will be able to read this book in a weekend.May we all be able to live in the moment like these whales have for thousands of years. Their intelligence is much needed in these days when our allegedly more intelligent species, can't get beyond such insanity as war and environmental degradation.Paul Nelson"
339,"This book is one of the most profound and wonderful books I have ever had the pleasure of reading! It's a beautiful true story that tells of two animal communicators, Mary and her good friend Raphaela, and their conversations with Granny. Granny is a 92 (est.) year-old orca who lives in the Pacific Northwest with her family, J Pod. During Mary and Raphaela's time conversing with Granny, they question her on many aspects of orca life from finding food to orca spirituality. Granny relays a very important message to the human race in this book. A message that MUST NOT be overlooked! This book should be read and emabraced by all. Granny's words certainly opened my eyes and made me see things in a different light. Open your mind and your heart. Read this book!"
340,"When I first picked up the book, Communicating with Orcas by Mary Getten, I was mildly interested in learning about Orca whales. After reading the first few pages I found that I could not put this book down until I had finished reading it. This book is awesome, entertaining, witty, and written from a totally unique whale's perspective which can not help but captivate you. Communicating with Orcas is skillfully presented to communicate points that Granny wishes to make about the life of whales, her profound observations of the human race, and the essential roll that the whales play in raising the consciousness of the earth. Before reading this book, I would never have entertained the idea that communication with a whale or any other animal for that matter could indeed be possible. One has to be able to accept that things do exist that are not readily proven or explained by Newtonian scientific theories. The insight provided in this book will truly astound you. Many past cultures had a closeness to nature that has been lost in today's world. This book takes a refreshing step back into what was and is still possible if we are open to believing"
341,"This is well worth the read if only to gain information about the pods of Orcas that are resident around the San Juan Islands. But well beyond that, whether or not one accepts the author's ability to communicate with the orcas, what she relates about the wisdom of whales (primarily Granny, the 90+year old leader of J pod) is a wake-up call for humanity."
342,"Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
343,"I found this book amazing. I'm from Michigan and we ""Michiganders"" tend to think about lakes not oceans. This book opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about the world. It also made me start to think about the oceans creatures in more than just a ""far away"" way. If you do believe in animal communiation you will find this book to be a wonderfully different type of perspective. If you think animal communication is a ""bunch of nonsense"" this book may seem really strange to you, but it also makes you start to think ""What if the whales do think, What if other animals think, what would they think of us and our running, running rather than enjoying and loving life"" I highly recommend this book to all!!"
344,"I LOVED Mary Getten's book ""Communicating with Orcas"". I couldn't put it down. Reading it, my sense of life's inter-connectedness was profoundly deepened. After I read this book I looked at all life with new eyes and a new heart.I was touched by Getten's love and respect for the Orcas and her courage to share this information with the world. I mean, where else are you going to learn about, among other things, whale sex from their perspective!!!? Her conversations with Granny made me laugh at times, cry at others. They changed me.I have given this book as a gift to several friends and find myself lending out my copy frequently. Reading this book fosters a new reverence for life. Sharing this book with others is one way I work to bring healing to the earth."
345,"i guess there are still come people out there who feel that telepathic communication with animals is impossible. They must not live with pets! I live with 3 dogs and i KNOW we communicate. One thing that is great about this book is that Mary Getten is a scientist, and brings that objectivity to her studies of the orcas. She enlists another communicator, Raphaela Pope, so that they can confirm each other's information. I found this book to be a very well-rounded piece of scientific journalism, they interviewed their subjects on many different topics to present an in-depth view of life from a whales's perpective. I haven't spent much time with whales but this book was a great introduction, probably the best!!"
346,The book came within 5 days Yeah!!! It was in perfect condition. This is a great read!
347,"Hearing straight from the whales.. who knew!!How refreshing to hear the whales speak through Mary Getten. This book is informative, funny, insightful and filled with the kind of respect all the sentient beings deserve. Her book is a glimpse of how well Mary ""listens""not only to the cetaceans but all her animal clients. It's heartfelt and honest.Mary's encounters had me steeped in the experience.. It was as if I was right there.I could feel the whales on every page and it made me cry.If you love whales this will take you straight into their world!!! What a great ride!!Thank God people are finally waking up to the truth about communicating with animals..It's about time.. they have so much to teach us.. certainly we can't be that arrogant!!!"
348,"I got this book about 3 years ago, and I was really excited, because I got it for Christmas. Little did I realise I was actually getting a narative about a woman who says she can telepathically communicate with animals.Now, don't get me wrong. I have done research into the telepathic Animal Communication, even as a freshman in college right now I have done more research into it. And even though there seems to be something, I have yet to see a bonified scientific study followed by a scientific peer reviewed paper on these experiences people have. And even as a person going into a minor Psychology I know that Psychological and behavioral studies are very difficult, becuase of the amazing amount of variables that are caused by the extremely complex brain, alone. But even I can not take much of this at face value.I believe her, I don't think she is lying. I question the validity of the actual communication. Is she really linking mentally to this orca, or is this her not fully understanding the duality that many people fall into, and is she thinking that is J2 (or Granny we call her) talking to her?I really want to give her credit and I really wanted to believe her, but I can't. She didn't give me much to really grab onto as a convincing argument for her so called abilities. And she is not the first animal communicator I have done a little research on. There was one woman mentioned in ""Freeing Keiko"" who said that whales and dolphins were essentially extraterrestrial beings that were guiding the earth through space. Another woman said that Greyhound dogs were also extraterrestrial beings.Just the simple fact that there is glaring inconstancies between different animal communicators should be enough evidence that there really isn't too much, if anything, to Telepathic Animal Communication.It was an entertianing book, I rather enjoyed it. But I am a sceptic. And being a sceptic I would be completely honest about my position. If something really seems to make sense, I will say it does. But this book didn't. And saying that, I would not be talking about this book to my friends or family. If it does turn up in conversation, it will most likely be during our psuedopyschological studies. That is unless someone can show me a real study that is so sound as to prove me wrong. To which, if it did prove me wrong I would say so."
349,"This book contains some 25 chapters of a woman and a female Orca communicating telepathically. It changed my entire perspective on animal intelligence, and opened me to greater human possibilities that I had been denying but now know are possible.So dont listen to the nay-sayers. Pick up this book and decide for yourself what you really think about this phenomenon.George Denniston MD"
350,"Jill Malter gives a terrible review to any book that dares to say, even in the most timid way, that the Palestinians might have the teeniest bit of a point. The pattern suggests that this is her automatic reaction to any book that does not agree with her prejudices. So please disregard her reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
351,"I surft on this book out of mild curiosity. But reviews like the three posted here convince me that the book must be well worth reading. So I'm buying it. Thanks, team! (I apologize for the 5 stars, since I haven't read it yet. But the program wouldn't let me post this comment without a rating. I'll get back to y'all when I'm finisht reading the book.)"
352,"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
353,"Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
354,"Most of the authors of this book say, in effect, that they are accused of being anti-American. By right-wing fanatics! But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest. And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well. On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism. What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani. He moans that ""pro-Israel lobbying groups"" and others are ""policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse."" Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this. He says that Lawrence Summers ""effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism."" That's a lie. He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom. And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors. Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it! He tells us to speak and act before it is too late. I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's ""extracurricular"" work should be protected. My feeling is that it should be. Noam Chomsky is used as an example. I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies. Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was ""disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."" But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader. In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired. Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom? I hope not.Judith Butler repeats the slander that ""any criticism of Israel"" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks. And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement. If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest. Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote ""violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."" Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work. But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs. But I think she's the problem here. There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities. The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government. If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin. Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs ""the American Likud."" He says ""this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."" And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy. But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less. A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch. This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is ""false and brazenly bigoted."" It is neither. Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.This book pretends to be defending academia. In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty. This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study. I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards."
355,"This is, all-around, a pretty good lawn book. However, there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly, leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower, which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only, so if you have loads of tall weed grasses, or are using a non-mulching mower, you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read, spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration, which is admittedly more difficult and expensive, is what gets the best results, and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects:[...]"
356,I bought this book as a present. They loved it. It was in perfect condiotion. This is one terrific backpack. Trust worthy seller. Will buy from again.
357,This book is a godsend for the layperson. It contains many straight-forward and informative chapters regarding all aspects of lawn care from starting from scratch to rejuvenating a tired lawn and everything in between. Very easily read and understood. I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in a great lawn.
358,Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again.
359,"After reading through this book twice, highlighting various tips and tidbits, I realized that I couldn't put it all together into one organized plan. So I went through the book a third time, taking notes, and trying to categorize the author's advice. Guess what? It's not possible. This how-to book IS very disorganized, and worse, internally inconsistent. However, I concluded that if I just took a stab at using parts of his advice, formulas, when-to's, etc., that my lawn would probably improve. It did. No question. I like the fact that his methods are easy and inexpensive. I got much better results than I did with my previous 6x/year TrueGreen lawn service for $250. If you're interested in understanding what your lawn wants, this book has the advice if you're willing to sift through the disorganization."
360,"I bought this book for my husband. He follows it faithfully, and you can see the results in our yard. We have the most beautiful, lush grass in the neighborhood - which seems to be a miracle, since our yard was an overgrown field just two years ago. Jerry Baker provides simple ways to establish and maintain your lawn. I also appreciate the fact that we do not have to go to a gardening store to find the items recommended in his book."
361,"General information is good. Jerry writes about everything from lawn equipment, watering, home to homemade tonics. However, the book is very disorganized. Jerry did a very poor job of summarizing the steps to a great lawn."
362,"I'm sure my fellow gardeners have noticed how a nicely tended strip of grass sets off a garden bed perfectly! Designers say our eyes need a place to rest before we can see all the beauty in front of us. Although most people make their New Years resolutions in December or January, I promise myself every July I am going to do something about my grass.....something other than dig it all up. We've all seen Jerry Baker on television spraying ammonia and dish soap all over his yard...I find it very intriguing. Jerry's book on lawn care has a ton of info to offer..and true enough it is a little hard to follow sometimes, but most people will not do everything anyway. For my poor lawn anything is an improvement, so if you are task-oriented, schedule based and really really care about your lawn this book should be very helpful. There are a lot of chemicals included in the regimen so beware if you like me avoid them. But there is a lot here that will be used on my own little patch of soon to be healthier grass. If you want more details, reviews of other gardening books or simple little garden musings."
363,"This book is not a detailed lawn program for lawn care. It is more or less a collection of articles and tips on lawn care. I certainly found many useful tips and helpful advice as I read through the book. However, in reading it front to back you will find that Mr. Baker differs in some small details from one presentation to the next, but his overall conception of what goes into a good lawn remains quite consistent throughout.Mr. Baker offers several of his famous tonics that I look forward to trying. Some of the advice seems a tad dated - he talks about buying things from Brookstone that aren't offered on their website anymore and he doesn't mention his own website www.jerrybaker.com that does offer many of them and more.The book discusses different types of grass and weeds, but doesn't offer much in the way of pictures. There are books that do and I find the pictures of the weeds very helpful in identifying them. But this book does offer state-by-state help on certain things and resources you can tap to get more information - very helpful.This book is certainly worthy the price I paid for it and I like the tips I picked up. It isn't perfect, but deserves a place on your shelf."
364,"I have never enjoyed caring for my lawn before. This book makes it fun, the results are gratifying. If you love being outdoors and tinkering in the yard and garden--this is the formula."
365,"Jerry shows you very simple and inexpensive ways to improve your lawn and garden. Though some of the items he uses, mostly household products, seem starange at first; the results are OUTSTANDING.... We no have the best looking lawn in the entire neighborhood.I am not letting my neighbors know about this one :)"
366,"The book gives good tips on lawn care, but must be one of the most disorganized writings I have ever seen. Information is provided in bits and pieces here and there, and is someitmes inconsistent. For example, the beer &amp; amonia tip is given on at least three occaisions, each time with different mixture ratios and &quot;optimal&quot; application dates. Chapter 11 makes a half-baked effort do give a summary of the most important points in one place, only to be followed by a Q&amp;A chapter the muddles the situation. If you have the patience and desire to sort out the mess I think that the book is well worth the price."
367,"I've read so many lawn books that beat around the bush (no pun intended!) This book has the simple, and effective techniques clearly spelled-out. And it's entertaining, too. Highly recommended for anyone who has a problem lawn (like mine USED to be)."
368,"This summer we had a lot of extremely hot days here near Chicago. The book explained how to make the best of the hot days to save my lawn. Got to say they worked. Wish you could see my lawn now, it looks great."
369,"What a wonderful book! As an interested layperson with no background in philosophy or ethics, I've been trying to answer the question ""What, exactly, does it mean to live a moral (Christian) life?"". While this clear and highly readable book isn't meant to give superficially pat answers of the Chicken-Soup-for-the-Soul genre, its thorough explaination and assessment of the dramatic changes of thought of one of the most influential Christian theologians of our time allowed me to understand why Roman Cathohlics currently believe what they (we) beieve and how they got there. This book, while not taking sides, gave me the background to think more productively and clearly about my question."
370,"An excellent work on one town's experience in the Holocaust. It contains an excellent array of documents from the time, hidden at great risk by the inhabitants. This book should dissuade any reader of the notion that the Jews of Europe did not fight back."
371,"This over-sized 255 page volume is based a November 1991 through October 1999 U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibit on the experiences of Kovno Ghetto residents during World War II, as they secretly photographed and artistically recorded them.In addition, the volume contains many images of Ghetto work documents and other Nazi-issued papers, and even the luggage tags of Jews transported from Germany and Austria for murder at ""Fort IX,"" a fortification built near Kovno specifically to murder Jews, which executions began on June 24, 25, and 27, 1941, following the Nazi invasion of Lithuania.On October 28, 1941, the Germans separated 30,000 Jews from the square in Kovno, those to the left survived at least temporarily, and those to the right, were immediately marked for brutalization and ultimate death. for the time being, 20,000 remained. Everyone left lost a family member, and mourning set upon the community.Needless to say, their lot was not easy, and most ultimately succumbed.This is a valuable testament to horrors suffered in the Holocaust by one community, horrors that were repeated in every other ghetto across Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and so on.Heartbreaking.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
372,"This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
373,"Over 3000 years old, Chinese medicine is based on the Taoist holistic vision of balancing all the body harmonies. This book is a lavishly illustrated and complete guide to every aspects of this tradition. It is not a self-help book, but a guide explaining the concepts and principles and providing a detailed description of certain therapeutic exercises that everyone can use to optimise health.Part One explores the theories behind the medicine, including basic principles like Yi and Yang, the basic substances like Qi and energy flow, the meridian system, the zangfu system and the causes of disharmony.Part Two considers the Chinese approach to diagnosis, including diagnostic techniques like looking, hearing, questioning and touching, and includes an overview of the patterns of disharmony.Part Three deals with Chinese approaches to treatment, including the principles of treatment and diagnosis and specific modalities like acupuncture, herbalism, qigong and lifestyle factors such as exercise, diet and feng shui.The Further Reading section consists of bibliographies under headings like general, herbal, diet and others. A list of useful addresses in various countries is supplied and the At-A-Glance Directory is an illustrative index to finding treatments. The book concludes with a glossary and index and contains full colour illustrations and photographs."
374,"As a physician who is studying and doing acupuncture, I find this a good basic introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is heavily illustrated, which helps the reader to understand some very difficult concepts, which are alien to the Western mind, especially for medical personnel. I can highly recommend it for someone who is interested in becoming familiar with Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine."
375,"This book was loaned to me by a fellow physician and I had a hard time giving it back. It's a great resource for information that covers a little of everything in Chinese Medicine. I practice acupuncture and have found much of the information useful for preparing lectures, not only for the general public, but for other physicians as well. It's a versatile book good not only for it's comprehensive content, but also as a coffee table book as the illustrations are great. Would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the vast offerings of Chinese Medicine."
376,"My partner is a Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. Her basic education took 5 years to complete. Five years later, she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine, they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home, the other is in our Chinese Medicine office. Many of our patients have purchased their own copy of this book after reading our office copy.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best book that I have read to understand what my partner practices. I have read other books, likeThe Web That Has No Weaver : Understanding Chinese MedicineandBetween Heaven and Earth: A Guide to Chinese Medicine, although highly recommended, these 2 books are much more technical and can be overwhelming at times (especially The Web 2nd edition). After reading The Complete Illustrated Guide, if you want to learn more then these other two books are worth a read. Far and away the best dietary book on Chinese Medicine is Bob Flaw'sThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicine. Also,The Book of Jook: Chinese Medicinal Porridges--A Healthy Alternative to the Typical Western Breakfastby Bob Flaws is a good helpful for breakfast food and as a total diet longevity practice (similar to Kitchari in Ayurveda).The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine provides a complete overview of all of the modalities included under the largre umbrella of Chinese Medicine. You'll learn about the medicine theory, diagnosis, energetic ""anatomy"", acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, qi gong, tai chi, meditation, and lifestyle theory.The section on diet is lacking, in my opinion, however the author does state that information on diet could fill an entire book itself - which is definitely true. ReadThe Tao of Healthy Eating: Dietary Wisdom According to Traditional Chinese Medicinefor proper Chinese Medicine dietary knowledge.The sections on Qi Gong and Tai Chi are great for a general book. You'll be taught a basic sequence in each. For additional learning, Mantak Chia's books and DVDs are some of the most complete spiritual-style Qi Gong practices practices. Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has created some of the best martial arts style Qi Gong and Tai Chi books and DVDs.The theory and science sections make up the majority of this book, providing an excellent introduction with much knowledge and no fluff. Someone interesting in attending TCM school would greatly benefit by reading this book first. You'll understand what TCM is and have good preparation for the conceptual basis of Chinese Medicine.The entire book is filled with pictures to support the information. A picture is worth 1,000 words and many times it is only through pictures that proper understanding can be attained (like meridians, tongue diagnosis, etc). The book is very well organized with section titles and concise paragraphs with subtitles. It is clear that the authors spent much time and calculation to create this book.Personally, I can't think of anything missing from this book. Although I would have liked to see another 2-4 pages on dietary theory and practice, it is not strong enough of a complaint to remove a star from my rating. This book is 5 stars all the way!Additional note:It is important to remember that Chinese Medicine is a medicine and should only be practiced by a trained professional. There is a lot that a person can do to improve health and grow spiritually without the help of a Chinese Medicine practitioner/doctor - like diet, exercise, meditation, qi gong, yoga, etc. However when it comes to deeper knowledge and practices like Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine, these are best left to the professionals. My partner is a professional Chinese Medicine Acupuncturist and Herbalist. It is common that people come into her office who are worse off after having self-treated using herbal knowledge from books, magazines, and newscasts. Taking herbs for symptom relief is not anywhere close to the Chinese Medicine herbal understanding. If you are suffering from health problems, please see a professional.After it's complete, an education in Chinese Medicine is a 5 year Ph.D. program (including both Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine). This is an entire year longer than Western Medicine. This is not to say that Chinese Medicine is superior, but rather that both studies are long and difficult. Chinese Medicine should not be looked at to be inferior to modern Western medicine. Rather both are complete forms of medicine and require much more understanding than can be gained by a single text book.The Complete Illustrated Guide to Chinese Medicine is the best place to start to better understand what Chinese Medicine is and how you can live a healthier and happier life.Was my review helpful?

379,"As someone who has been practicing Chinese Medicine for 16 years in San Diego (www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com), I find this book an excellent resource for anyone who wants and in dept primer into the theoretical basis and practical application of a system of medicine that originates in the Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the natural balance found in Nature and agriculture."
380,This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine.
381,Concise and clear introduction to Chinese Medicine. Easy to read and understand.
382,"I wanted a book that could give me a guide to Chinese Medicine that would help me understand what it is and how it linked with the things I have picked up in my life. Thank you for the author and producers of this book for going a long way to helping me achieve a basic and fundamental understanding of the subject.There may well be other books on the topic of equal merit, I simply have read few.In Love and Light"
383,emsl this was a great book to have as a reference for a practitioner. with that low price you can't beat it
384,"If you are a pilot and or sailor I would reccommend it highly. It was intriguing since the novel was action packed with various twists and turns and a touch of reality. I am a pilot and a sailor and his depiction of both activities was refreshing. Also, if you have travelled the Caribbean as I have you; you will find that the author captures the essence of them and brings back vivid memories. The story covers many areas such as Romance, Mystery, Suspense, Action, and Adventure."
385,"How the world has changed since Harvey Cox argued that there is an inevitable and inexorable process of global secularization which is leading to a total separation of the political and religious. Cox's argument was that urbanization and secularization go together, and that they empty the world of mythic and traditional religious power.Today forty years after the publication of his book the world is in the midst of a global struggle in which the forces of Western democratic society are pitted against a radical Islamic revivalist fundamentalism. Moreover within the realms of other religions including Christianity there has been a kind of 'return to religion' which was certainly not dreamnt of in Cox analysis. He did not have a clue in regard to the Evangelical revival in the United States, and the prominent place it would come to play, ( Perhaps unprecedented place) in American politics.This does not make Cox's analysis wrong for his time. Nor was he mistaken in seeing the important trend to secularization. He only made the mistake most of us make of seeing the past and future of what seemed to him the predominant and irreversible trend of his time.But History and the development of Mankind have a way of surprising us all.As a footnote I would say that the one area of the world in which Cox analysis does seem to be largely correct today is Europe. 'Post-Christian Europe' however does not seem the apogee of human enlightentment , the wave of the future. Rather it seems more a declining island already invaded by those kind of 'religious forces it expelled as Christian and is receiving as Muslim'.Irony of ironies, that the very heart of the 'secular city' today seems as if it will in a matter of generations take a great fall into backwardness. But again this is an aside, and I would instead make the more general caveat, that no one should fall so readily into the underlying assumption of Cox's analysis i.e. that there is a predominant historical trend for the future which we can clearly discern.Wisdom and humility would suggest that we rely more on our powers of future observation than of extrapolation from the Past."
386,"It was encouraging to find a book dedicated solely to the Audi Quattro in the first place-- but then reading and looking at the photos inside encouraged me to write my brief words of praise here. And just wait until you see some of the older Quattros pictured in this book... The Audi Quattro has finally been given the time in research and documentation that VWs have had for years, and now, hopefully, we will see more interest taken and given within the auto restoration world in these fun-to-drive and collectible cars. Now if Meredith would just turn his talents to the Saab 900...(or has he and I simply don't know!?!)"
387,"A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read."
388,"Kerri is a genius at her craft, not only am I getting an informative overview of the world's natural wonders, but I'm also learning how to use metrics! The design of this book is great as well. Love, love, love it!"
389,"A friend gave me this book a couple of years ago and I find that I return to it again and again. It is a series of 365 short meditations on being in relationship with God. The meditations can be, at times, astoundingly difficult to understand. But every now and then one pops out that is so perfect I am convinced that this crazy Spanish mystic must have been on to something.If you are trying to deepen your relationship with the Divine, do yourself a favor: Get this book."
390,"If sometimes the meaning is inaccessible the emotion and spirit is not. Here there is a strong mission-minded and mystical insight into the reflections of one of the great minds of medieval Christianity. Llull, who is known as a missionary, poet, novelist, mystic, philosopher, father and husband, and even perhaps an alchemist, strongly connects tribulation-suffering with the greater experience of God's love. A challenging message."
391,"This is 1 of da bst books dat i have EVER read! @ my school, we are doing a play on this & im playin Mary-Lynette. i cant wait 2 get to the last chapters when they finally give in 2 each other! Gr8 books!"
392,first of all i thought that this was one of lj smith's best books she has written adn also the funniest. i love all the characters but my fave one in the book is Ash. he's really a hottie and a babe i just love him 4 trying 2 be real. so far ash and thierry are my 2 most fave male characters in the night world series. anyways this book is about 3 sisters who are fugitives from the night world trying to live normal lives with humans but finding out that theyre brother Ash wants them back home. and meets up with mary- lynnette who turns out to be his soulmate but doesnt want it as much as she doesnt want it either. anyways i thought Ash was a much better character in daughters of darkness than in secret vampire i thought he acted like a jerk in the 1st night wortld book. it tells me that he has gotten better and that not all humans are bad to live by. i would love to have a guy like Ash for a bf. he's a total babe. funny 2. well g2g also if anyone is waiting for strange fate 2 come out it wont be coming out til 2004.
393,"Once started I couldn't put it down, literally. I didn't stop til I'd read it through.Three sisters on the run from the Night Worlds patriachal society, they visit Oregon. Their brother finds out where they are and tries to drag them back, except for a few minor details he has it all figured out. 1. someone else knows where the girls are and if Ash doesn't bring them back, Quinn will bring in the authorities. 2. Ash has found his soulmate Mary-Lynette who also knows their secret identity. 3. someone killed their aunt and they don't know who, is it a vampire hunter or someone who knows the truth.The vampires are in danger and Ash and Mary-Lynette have fallen in love. END"
394,"This book is probably, in my opinion, one of (if not THE) worst in the Night World Series. It is Ash's story this time, who's soulmate just happens to be a human. (which Ironically was shadowed upon in the first book, 'Secret Vampire'.) Ash's character was cool, charismatic....and totally wasted in this book. Mary Lynnette was too self riteous, too...I don't know. To me, she didn't come off as the strong female lead she was supposed to. Instead, I found myself annoyed at her several times throughout the book. She was presumptuous, she was always assuming things, and she was rather stereotypic if you ask me. I think someone like Maggy from 'Black Dawn', or even someone like Hanna or Gillian from 'Soulmate' and 'Dark Angel' would have been a better match for Ash, not this smart alec, holier than thou woman named Mary Lynnette.The book itself was lacking as well. We pretty much learn nothing about the nightworld, it doesn't much progress the series except to mention a few characters that appear in future books. All in all, a disappointment. Ash's first appearance in 'Secret Vampire' stole the show, so when this book was released, I was ecstatic. 'Finally', I thought. 'Something that touches on Ash's past and personality. We will finally get to read his story.' Well, as it turned out, he was poorly underwritten. Or perhaps this particular book would have worked better if it had been a little later in the series, if Mary Lynnette wasn't so sharp tongued, if there weren't so many CHARACTERS to concentrate on. This wasn't so much Ash and M.L's story as it was all the sisters. Too many people to concentrate on. The three sisters should have been given their own book for character developement if that was the case. I would suggest this book only to those who wish to further their Night World series collection, or just their L.J Smith collection, in general. As for the enjoyment factor?...Nadda."
395,"The plot and characters are incredible. Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!"
396,"This book is O.K ,even though it doesn't match The Chosen. Ash is so much better than he was in #1 , even though you can tell he hasn't really had a personality makeover . I loved the bit where Mary-Lynette is taking STRIPS off him for patronizing Jeremy , and he suddenly screams &quot; For G-d's sake,don't patronize me !&quot; G-d , he's cute ( Quinn's cuter though, thank G-d she mentions him ! ) Please E-mail me - honestly - if you want to talk about Lisa's ADORABLE characters (male or female ) . By now , Natalya"
397,"The plot, setting, mood and atmosphere in Daughters of Darkness was very potential. Ms. Smith developed the characters very well. The only improvement for this book should be the style and wording of the text. Even though L.J. Smith describes her characters well, she tends to repeat things more than necessary. It is good to remind the readers what a charater looks and acts like, but it seems that every other page she repeated the same thing or switched the characters in the content like she could not think of anything else to say."
398,"This book is the best book I've ever read(and I've read ALOT of books!)in my entire life. It's so real. If I had one wish, it'd be to meet these people. Ash is...amazing, and I really admire Mary Lynnette's strength. It'd be interesting (if scary) if the Night World were real."
399,"This is the second book of hers I have read,and I didnt want it to end!! Ash is a well written character, so is Jeremy!! Like the others I have read I think this would make a pretty fair movie!! This is an absolute must read!!"
400,Hey every one how did you like this book. It was the best book I have ever read of the L.J Smith.
401,"This is my favorite out of all the Night World books I love how Mary-Lynnette and Ash didn't get along at first i thought it was funny and cute. I recommend this bok to anyone It is really a must reader. Ciao All, Sky"
402,"Though the plot is much like that of Pride and Prejudice, this book has a real feeling and flow that the rest of the Night World books can't compare with. There is a depth of character in both Mary-Lynnette, Ash, his sisters and Mark that L.J. Smith can usually only spin in the three books of her earlier trilogies. The departure of Ash at the end of the book has left me, now more than a year later, still anticipating his return, and the furthering of the relationship between him and Mary-Lynnette. The characters seemed more down-to-earth and more easy to identify with, as the author didn't go into the somewhat fascinating but still pointless and shallow descriptions of every physical characteristic of the characters. Mary-Lynnette seemed a truly real girl, with dreams of her career in astronomy and her share of problems. Ash, although made a spectacle of with his good looks in the first novel of the Night World, was intelligent and portrayed well. I wish that Ms. Smith had chosen to chronicle this book into an entire trilogy as she has in the past; I would have found Mary-Lynnette and Ash even more enthralling if we had seen their development over the course of a longer period."
403,"This is the all time best book. She mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire, who knows. Well anyway I like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush. P.S I think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world."
404,I trust every girl is now inlove with Ash?? We ll I sure am cause he is gorgeous and his eyes......????? Heaven. Ok now this book was well written I like that it included love springing between other characters(Mark and Jade) The part I LOVED was when Ash was leaving and was saying he wanted to become human and everything that was so...romantic.he wanted to become something he has always hated in order to be with her......(email for chats)Who has irc?? Cause we have to make a channel for all us soulmate wanters!!!
405,"I have read just about everything L.J. Smith has ever written. It all started when a friend of mine gave me The Strange Power- Vol. 1 of my favorate L.J. trilogy entitled Dark Visions and I loved it! I read everything I could get my hands on by her!! Before I discovered these books I never read anything due to sheer boredom. Now I feel that these books have helped me immensly! Anyway, I really should get on to my comments concerning the book. Daughters Of Darkness is really one of the best Night World books of all. It is sweet, suspenseful, and well written all in one great package. Unfortunetly, though these book literally melt my heart, I am afriad I will never find a man worthy of my all time favorate L.J. Smith badboys such as Ash(Daughters of Darkness), Gabriel(mmm.. oh! um Dark Visions), Nick(Secret Circle), and Quinn(short but sweet... from The Chosen). Oh well!! Anyhow read the books, people!! Then you'll know what I'm talking about!! OK!!???"
406,"This is the best book L.J. has written, and I've read all seven (they're all good). I'm still waiting for Black Dawn to come out. Mary-Lynnette and Ash are so realistic, besides that he's a vampire. My favorite part is when Mare keeps kicking him in the shins. It's funny, because it also tells us (this is what I interpreted) that it doesn't matter what race you are, it matters whats on the inside. Afterall, like Jade says, &quot;You can't be soulmates with vermin!&quot"
407,"Set in Briar Creek, Oregon, ""Daughters of Darkness"" primarily follows 17-year-old Mary-Lynnette Carter, though the book is supposedly about her new neighbors, three vampire sisters: Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern. The book does start off that way, following these three runaways on their way to their aunt's house. There they discover that their aunt has been killed--staked through the heart by a possible vampire hunter who wants to punish them for breaking the laws of the Night World, which all vampires, werewolves, and witches must abide by in this series. In an attempt to cover their tracks, the sisters bury the old woman in their backyard, but Mary-Lynnette sees them doing this--and again, later on, in the company of her younger brother, Mark, when they transfer the body into the woods.To make a long story short, Mary-Lynnette and Mark are befriended by these vampires in a blood-tie ceremony and promise to help find the killer running loose in Briar Creek. Like all of L. J. Smith's books, there's an added bit of romance to the paranormal/horror base of the story, for both Mary-Lynnette and Mark. (They meet their respective soulmates: Ash and Jade.) Even though I haven't read any of the other books in this series and can't compare this one to the others, I really liked ""Daughters of Darkness."" It was fast-paced, well-written, and ideal for teens who are into paranormal romances."
408,"I'm sorry, but I just find the way Mary Lennette treats Ash to be just hillarious. Mary Lennette is like a Nancy Drew. Ok, actually I never liked the Nancy Drew series and never read them, but the book kind of starts out with a mystery like that. She's just a character who if Iknew her in person, I'd probably like her. She's smart, and stands pretty much up for what she believes in and really does care for people. She's just totally not the person I could ever picture Ash with. I still can giggle at that part where she realizes he can see more in the dark and without thinking just shines the flashlight into his eyes. She discovers horribly diliated pupils, and Ash is just screaming out in pain. Then, right after that she asks him to tell her how many stars he can see, and he's just like &quot;None. I'm blind!&quot; I don't know, maybe the way I said it isn't that funny, but I thought it was hillarious. Ash is hillarious with his little side comments and he's simply a very interesting character. It took me awhile to get myself to finally buy it, but its definetly a good read."
409,"Daughters of Darkness, the second book in LJ Smith's Night World series, is probably the best book in the series.Mary-Lynette is the intellectual heroine in this book. She's a human obsessed with astromomy who's stumbled across a strange, supernatural secret about the new girls next door. Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are beautiful vampire sisters who have escaped from their strict home across the country. Mary Lynette and her brother, Mark, become quick friends with the sisters, but someone doesn't want them to live in harmony.And then there's the slight problem that the girls' brother, Ash (who appeared in the first Night World book, Secret Vampire), who has come to bring his sisters back. Ash is icy cold and ruthless, but Mary Lynette might just be the person to melt his heart.This book is so awesome that you won't want to put it down until you've finished. But I would definitely recommend reading the Night World series in order, since the characters reappear and the events link together, so if you haven't read Secret Vampire yet, do that first. But if you have, definitely read this book!"
410,"This is the best book out of the Night World series. At first, in the first book, u think Ash is the bad guy, but that opinion totally goes out the window when u read this book.(The same thing w/ Quinn, but that's another book) I have all the Night World books and love them all. I've read them all over and over, but this is my fav. I can totally relate w/ the feeling of longing Mary-Lynette felt at the beginning, and like her, I am looking for someone to share the night w/ (even though i know only a little about astronomy) Ash is definantly a character. He's strong-willed, and has a smart mouth, but is vulnerable like a hurt child underneath it all. There needs to be another book that continues the story of Ash, Mary-Lynette, Mark and the sisters. Ash had small parts in Dark Angel (when he got Gillian out of that club Angel lured her in) and in Soulmates (when he was in Circle Daybreak when he met Hannah and told her about his soulmate.) If you haven't read this one yet, it is a must read. I beleive in soulmates and it makes me wish for mine even more If only the Night World really existed . . . but oh well. I hope you bring in Mary-Lynette and Ash again, I would really like to know the outcome."
411,Can't believe I have never reviewed this book before. First read this back when I was 13. Like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soul-mates which drug me into these books. Rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me. Ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
412,"As an adult reader I gave this a 3 star because some things were not very logical. The story was well written and as a teen I think I would have given it a 4 maybe even a 5. I would not mind letting my children read this book as the love relationships are based on emotions rather than physical appearance and pleasure. The relationship between the characters are healthy, for example they do not have the male stalking the female or the female saying she is going to die without the male. Yes that is a comparison to the Twilight series, but this series was written long before Twilight was thought of.The parts I did not find logical is the fact the vampire girls were not going to use any of the powers in the new town they moved too. Why not? I get that they did not want to kill their food (people) but why not talk to each other telepathically. What is the point of not doing that? No one would have known they were doing that. Vampires are stronger than people and one girl had a hard time doing a task a human could do without a problem. Another thing that bothered me about this book is Poppy and James are not in this book. There was a thought of them for a second but I would have liked something to let me know how they were doing. Is Poppy still an illegal vampire? Did her dad except them and her living dead situation? I mean so many unanswered questions."
413,"Night World #2: Daughters of Darkness, by L. J. SmithFor me, ""Daughters of Darkness"" is the one sour note in Smith's Night World series. It was the one book in the nine book series that I had to force myself to finish (I am obsessive about finishing everything I read).The concept is interesting, but I feel it could have used better execution. As with all Night World books, the protagonist is female. Mary-Lynette is a human and unaware of the secret world of vampires, werewolves, and other spooky things that exist around her. She thinks she lives in the quietest, most boring town in the world, but that's all about to change when a series of startling events happens.When the next door neighbor goes missing just as her three nieces arrive in town, and Mary-Lynette sees them burying something in the backyard, she's immediately suspicious. Unable to leave the mystery alone, she heads next door and meets the new arrivals, who further her apprehension about the disappearance of her neighbor. The girls remind her of predators, which is unsurprising as the girls are lamia, or born vampires.The mystery of who killed the neighbor takes up a good chunk of the book, and in my opinion, is very over used. It just drags on too long, and every time there was a new twist in the whodunit, I kept thinking, ""Okay, that's the end of it now...no, wait...there's more. Sigh.""Ash Redfern also makes an appearance in this book (some readers may remember him from ""Night World #1: Secret Vampire,"" where he waylaid Poppy), and is a starring character along with his sisters. Initially he's on the hunt for the three sisters, who ran away from a vampire enclave. Ash is characterized as the ultimate vampire - humans are vermin and nothing more, to him. Mary-Lynette takes an immediate dislike to him when meeting him for the first time. And here's where the potentially interesting concept comes in - Ash and Mary-Lynette are soulmates, but unlike Smith's other couples, the two can't stand each other.But something about this book just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the overly drawn out murder mystery. Or maybe it was that the main character, Mary-Lynette, seemed dry. Or maybe even what seemed interesting - soulmates disliking each other - somehow doesn't fit in a series that's about finding your soulmate.1/5."
414,I loved the first book. the secondone I read in a day. I could not put it down. Ash really suprised me
415,"Let me start by saying that this was a great book like a lot of other Smith fans do hope that this book does have a sequel because i really really what to know what happens with Ash and Mary. I have read all the Night World book up to Witchlight, and for those of u how are tired of the soulmate principal then don't read the books! This is my fav book out of the N.W. series,(along with Soulmate) but i hope that Ma'lin changes her mind and desides to become a vampire. anyway if u people like romace, action, and humor then read this book. end"
416,"This has got to be one of my favorite books of the series and I have all of them but one. Mary-Lynette is one of my favorite characters in the series. I love the whole idea of vampires, witches, and shapeshifters existing. I love looking at the stars like she does. If you enjoy this book, you HAVE to read the other books in the series."
417,"This has got to be the best book I have ever read in my entire life. I thought it was really different how Mary-Lynette and Ash tried to ignore the fact that they were soulmates, and it made the story much more interesting to read. Personally, I never would have guessed that it was Jeremy who had killed the girls aunt 'cause he seemed like a relly nice guy, but I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. I really wish that there was a sequel to this book 'cause I really want to find out what happens with Ash and Mary-Lynette. This is definately the best Night World book - although they are all excellent. ~Mary"
418,"I loved this book so much! I couldn't put it down for a minute. I've read almost all of the Nightworld series, but this by far is the best. The humor and the romance that brings Ash and Mary-Lynette together is great. The ending was kind of sad though. I would definitely read any sequels to this book. I hope that there is one. For those people who think the soulmate principle is getting old, I disagree. The author should keep the theory, but add a few new twists or plots to provide conflict and interest."
419,"This was the first book that I read in the series and I loved it! I've read it about ten times. It's such a great book. I like how Ash is suddenly turned into a complete sap after meeting his Mary-Lynette. Did anyone notice that in the other two appearances that he made (in Dark Angel and Soulmate), he talks about his soulmate? Just something to think about."
420,"This book beats all other books printed in the age of humanity. I love the fact that she made Ash sound so sweet, even tough in the book Secret Vampire he sounded like a meany. She makes them sound so real I'm looking for people with black flowers on an item of their clothing. I'm actually looking for vampies!"
421,"I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is &quot;This is a paranormal disaster area!&quot;"
422,"This book was outstanding! I couldn't put it down for a second! I could really understand and identify with the characters. I love how it all leads up to something, and the irony is great."
423,"This book was outstanding! I couldn't put it down for a second! I could really understand and identify with the characters. I love how it all leads up to something, and the irony is great."
424,"I have read all of the Night world series up to number 9 (10 isn't out yet) and i really did like this one the best. I liked the rivalry between Ash and Jeremy, but don't think it should really be that severe. How could the two races get along, even if the vamps were more powerful, or the wolves are stupid? I have to admit the only corny part is the fact that the two pairs of soulmates are related. I just really liked this book, and think it is the best yet. I do want to see what happens to all of them later on, like say at the begining of the the battle to save the world. I just want to come back to see that Mary-Linnette and Mark are vamps, etc."
425,"I just loved this book, like tons of other people. It was a perfect match-up:Mary-Lynette and Ash. Jade and MArk. Very cool!! I liked Kestrel the best and wished she could be featured in her own book. I like the family history and all that. L.J has really thought all this out it seems. I also the like the plot and clonficts and how it's rexolved. I am glad that Mary-Lynette is going to do her own thing for the time being. I do reasllly want to know what happens with them though."
426,"I asked my sister one day to go and buy all the L.J SMITH titles I don't have.She is my favorite author because she is original and her books are spellbinding.Anyways, I got the NIGHT WORLD books. I read THE SECRET VAMPIRE and I really loved it. Then I read DAUGHTHERS OF DARKNESS and loved it more. I am a hopeless romantic and I love stories about adventure and death. I like the way she mixes both of them together without going overboard. She is my favorite author but I really wish that she could make her books come out monthly.And I wish that she could include other stories besides the soulmate principal. Like maybe a vampire killer as the main character.A totally wicked character that loves to kill. Maybe she could bring us what she feels goes through a killer's mind. There's a lot of other ways she could make us love her books,maybe if she described the NIGHT WORLD more. Maybe stopping and making the females a lot stronger instead of pitiful weaklings. Maybe they should be open-minded about becoming a vampire.Anyways, she's my favorite author and I love her books."
427,"It was dangerously funny. It mixed love in horror in a way Ithought never possible. I LOVE the character Ash. Actually, all thecharacters were facinating with a touch of there own. I hate the books that all the characters have the same, identical personalities to the point you're about to throw-up and this was not one of them,. My favorate part was when the sisters are hissing at Ash and Mary-Lynnette goes right up to him and kicks him in the shin and she descrides that her brother stared at her as if she had just stripped down naked and started to dance the Tango. END"
428,"I was sceptical about this book at first, I had never read L. J. Smith before, but my friend told me to read it and let me borrow her's. It was soo good. That was about a year ago. I have now read up to Black Dawn in the Night World series, and can't wait for more. I recomended these books to my other friends and they loved them too. I recomend ANY L. J. Smith books to anyone."

430,Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!
431,"Excellent. The best pair of soulmates yet. Ash is LJ Smith,s sexiest character."
432,"If I could, I would rate this book an 11. It was L. J. Smith's best ever. I have read up to Black Dawn and can't wait for the next: Whitchlight."
433,"I just re-read Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it. It has everything that you could want and more. Just one questionAre Mary-Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart, longing for the one person who can make their life complete?To find out keep reading!!"
434,"I've ready all the Night World books up to date, and this, I must say, is my favorite. All the characters are so realistic! They're people I can relate to and want to meet.Happy reading and happy hunting"
435,I totally love Ash...but as for the rest of the book..it was ok...there was a false clue in the book about who the bad guy really was...the one about the short blunt sticks...and also the whole vampire thing sounded like a wannabe christopher pike thing...especially the whole idea about &quot;forgetting&quot;...anyway...i love ash and i'd definitely read it again just to read about his character...i love all these misunderstood guys...
436,i really liked this book although it's only the second nightworld book i've read... it is really interesting and it's definitely worth reading!!!i'm wondering why it's so hard to find this series in Singapore.
437,This was my favorite book until I read Huntress. It's so good. All of the characters are so well written. Ash is divine! M P &amp; M M A.
438,"Oh, gosh, Im in love with Ash! Pick me, Ash, please? Mary-Linnette didnt like you the way you were anyway...."
439,"I have loved all the Night World series, and this is another great installation! I loved Ash so much in this book. The entire series is great, but &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; definitely ranks within the Top 3 of the series!"
440,"This bok has got to be L.J. Smith's best yet! I couldn't put it down, and Ash is the best male character she's introduced yet!! I hope that there will be a sequel where Ash and Mary-Lynnette are reunited. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!"
441,"This book was so amazing! Mary-Lynnette is a character who I can really relate to, myself being obssessed with astronomy also. I loved Ash, almost as much as I do Julien from the Forbidden Game Trilogy. L.J. Smith is a terrific writer!"
442,I love Lisa Jane Smith's books! I especially like the way she carries the soulmate principle throughout all of the &quot;Night World&quot; series. I really liked this book and I think anyone who reads it will too.
443,"I loved this book very much!It was excellent.I absoloutly fell in love with Jeremy.He was such a sweet,nice guy.I thought it was unfair that he died.The last few times I read this book I had tears streaming down my face.I really don't think he was crazy just misunderstood.This is a must read book. Once you pick it up you can't put it down."
444,"It was a good book. But the thing I don't understand is how Mary-Lynnette and Mark drank Kestral, Jade and Rowan's blood while being human. Yecch!. On top of that the blood tasted sweet and smelled like Vanilla. Gimme a break!"
445,"I loved the action part!! Also, sometimes I wished Mary-Lynette could just embrace the fact that she loves Ash! I could fall in love with Ash myself! haha!"
446,"Daughters of DarknessL.J. Smith1996I continue to be surprised by how overally well-written the ""Night World"" books are, collectively. For young people in particular, they are quality fiction.Three young female vampires come to tiny Briar Creek, Oregon, to live with their also-vampire elderly aunt, but homicide is the word of the day, and curious neighbors Mark and Mary-Lynette quickly find themselves ensconced in the dangerous waters of the Night World -- and the even more unpredictable currents of love.I didn't quite like ""Daughters"" as much as ""Secret Vampire"", the first book in the series. The tale had a bit less... urgency... than its predecessor, and while I did like the redemption of Ash, bad-boy blonde from the first novel, the character development was again a little underexplored. But the world-building is pleasant and well-done, without info-dumping on young readers with potentially short attention spans.Again I can't help but wonder what a greater length could have done for the series -- ""Daughters' ""plot is a bit simplistic. The ending felt... unsatisfying.But without doubt worth a read, as I will wager the entire series will be.6.8/10"
447,"I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"
448,"It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"
449,LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!
450,"I thought this story was amazing, even better than the first. I was happy to see Ash return and a lot of charecter development happen to him. He's now one of my favriote charecters. And Mary-Lynette is definatly a strong Female charecter! If your looking for some twisted Night World romance this is the book to read. It's full of vampires and magic unlike ever before!"
451,"Truthfully, I first started getting into L.J. Smith's bookswith Vampire Diaries, but this book puts itself at the top of my listof cool books. Most of the appeal is in the way Mary-Lynette treats Ash Redfern. At first she REALLY doesn't like him, but after a while she realizes he's her soulmate, though their relationship doesn't magically become all right."
452,"I think this book is one of the greatest of all times! I havn't read any other L.J. Smith's books but out of all the books I've read, this is the top on my list. It was romantic but funny. I hope L.j. smith goes back to the writing... V.S. Read it!"
453,"this book is kinda different from the other ones. why? because there are two couples of the soulmate thing. rowan, kestrel, and jade (who finds their aunt murdered)has moved next door to mary-lynette and mark. later, ash, their brother comes along. together, the two families try and find out who has killed Aunt Opal. meanwhile jade and mark are instantly attracted and mary-lynette and ash are slowly, but strongly pulled together too, but they sort of have problems since their characters sort of clash. ne wayz, it's really good book. read it!"
454,i think that this is probebly to me the best night world book i have read. My favourite characters were probebly Kestral and Ash but they were all really good characters. i think this book is a brilliont read and recomend it to any one its kind of a romantic horror. I really enjoyed this book it was the first night world book i read and now i'm hooked so if you buy the book i hope you enjoy it.
455,"DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies."
456,This book was great and I just loved Ash. It should have 5 stars from everyone. And you have to read it. It was great. I did not like what happened to Jeremy but it was still the best book in the Night World series! It keeps you reading to the end. You will not put it down. I hope you read it for your sake. So read it!!
457,"Jade, Kestrel, and Rowan, three vampire sisters, have left their home in secrecy. Tired of living in a society that acts as though it's stuck in the 16th century, they decided to go live with their great-aunt. Unfortunately, she's been staked, and they have no idea who did it. Things are further complicated when Ash, their brother, comes to take them back. Ash gets something of a shock, however - he finds his soulmate in the small town of Briar Creek, and she's human.If you've read the first Night world book, you'll remember Ash. Believe it or not, he gets even better in this book. It's hilarious watching the usually confident Ash try to figure out how to deal with the reality of having a human soulmate (one who kicks him at every opportunity). This book is different from all the other Night World books, in that the soulmates here do not like each other and would like to find a way not to have that bond. I consider Ash to be one of the more complex characters in the series, and this book peels away a lot of the layers. Mary-Lynnette, his soulmate, is great, because she doesn't just let Ash walk all over her - she talks back, and, like I said, she kicks him a lot. The mystery element of the book is pretty interesting, and I liked the three sisters, although the author doesn't really go into as much depth with their characters as you might think she does from what the back of the book says. This book is less about the sisters and more about the murder, Ash, and Mary-Lynnette."
458,"Personally, I feel this book is the best in the Night World series, because I love the character Ash. He is such a hottie, though he has many personality flaws and actions to be ashamed of. That just makes him a more realistic character. Mary-Lynette and the rest of the characters are well thought-out also, and I hope to read about them in the future. This is my favorite series of L.J. Smith's, because in incorporates all creatures of the night. I look forward to reading Huntress and Black Dawn, since I've read all the other Night World books numerous times already, to indulge my fantasy craving mind. My only disappointment is that there are no shapeshifter soulmates. They must be just as intriguing as witches and vampires. And why can't I find Volume one of the Vampire Diaries anywhere? That series must be out of print, though it isn't old"
459,"Daughters of Darkness is the second book in the Night World series and centres around three groups of people - Mark and Mary Lynette Carter, two siblings who are wannabe astronomers, Rowan, Kestral and Jade Redfern, three vampire sisters escaping the confining life their previous home the vampire conclave, and Ash Redfern, their elder brother who's come to drag them home and successfully has L.J. Smith fans swooning in the aisles.It is an interesting premise, and things start to heat up when the girls arrive at their great-aunt Opal Burdock's house in Briar Creek only to find her staked through the heart. Panicking, they bury the body in the garden outside, but are witnessed by Mary-Lynette who's watching the stars on the hill overlooking the house. Doubtful that Mrs Burdock is really dead, Mary-Lynette and her brother nevertheless investigate, and come across the vampire sisters hunting in the wood...However, because Mark and Jade fall pretty fast for each other a truce is made and the sisters share their fears with the two siblings - something is out there, something that's killing things, and all of them work their dectective skills to figure out who it is ... Ash? Bunny Marten, the shop attendant with the lamia name? Jeremy, the garage worker with a deep, dark secret? A vampire hunter?And then Ash turns up, and to his and Mary-Lynette's horror, they find they are soulmates, destined to be together even though Ash is not a very nice guy.The story is pretty interesting, and it's fun to guess whodunnit, though I admit I was a *little* disappointed as to the murderer's motives. L.J. Smith obviously had fun designing the three sisters, all with different personalities and features. For once there wasn't a contrived happy ending that is so popular in L.J. Smith's books, and the atmosphere of the book was very well done too - the desert-like Briar Creek gave a sense of being trapped in the middle of nowhere with a wild beast on the loose, and chemistry between all the characters was realistic, poignent, and sometimes funny. (Watch out for Ash giving Jeremy a hard time).All in all, this was a much better book than the first 'Secret Vampire', which extented the Night World a bit, and mingled together characters that have been in previous books (Ash) and characters who'll appear in future ones (Quinn)."
460,"Book 2 of the Night World series, Daughters of Darkness, shifts focus to a new set of characters of the secret society. Relatives of James from the first book, we meet Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade. They are three vampire sisters who snuck away from home. Tired of the secret society, they want to try to live as humans out in Oregon. They move into a dilapidated old home, next to Mark and Mary-Lynette Carter. As Jade and Mark get closer, their brother Ash comes to town to bring his sisters back. Of course, he meets Mary-Lynette and things get interesting...Ash, the handsome blondie who we remember from the first book as being a conniving, selfish, and manipulative, experiences a bit of growth in this book. In the first book you would have never thought it would happen, but I was glad to see the character development.What I like about the Night World books is that while you could read each book separately as a stand-alone, it's great to see prior plot lines and character weaved into the current story. It makes you feel even more connected to the story and the world.These books are short reads, but I find them pretty satisfying because the plot moves along and it focuses on what you really want to see."
461,"Mary-Lynnette's wants seem simple enough. She likes her quiet life, stargazes as a hobby, bases her life around becoming an astronomer, and hopes the three new girls moving in next door with the kindly, if eccentric, Mrs. Burdock will help to bring her shy brother, Mark, out of his shell.Unfortunately, what she ends up with is a murder mystery, romance she doesn't want, and oh, yeah, those three new girls are vampires with a dangerous older brother coming to drag them back home.There are a LOT of characters to focus on, as per usual with a murder mystery. We have Mary-Lynnette, Mark, the three sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade, their brother Ash, and the local werewolf, Jeremy. And those aren't even the suspects. The endless supply of characters in such a short amount of pages is a little overwhelming, with so many aspects of so many characters not fully explored. But what really gets the reader, even the fans of over ten years, is the star-crossed attraction between Mary-Lynnette and Ash.It's a bumpy road, to put it lightly. Mary-Lynnette is a simple, if nosy, human girl, while Ash is a dangerous, well-known vampire--and not well-known in the good sense, in Mary-Lynnette's book. Understandable; in Secret Vampire and Daughters of Darkness it's implied he's killed human girls and worse. There are very subtle hints at sexual abuse toward human females that younger readers may miss, but the words are enough to paint a picture that Ash is Very Bad.Many fans complain at the ending, but it is the ending that keeps them so captivated with these two. Mary-Lynnette wants to finish high school. She can't see herself with Ash as he is now, knowing his past. Ash is sorry and wants to repent, by the end of the novel, but wanting isn't enough. Mary-Lynnette is dealing with a soulmate who is potentially mentally unstable, definitely cruel, and by all human means, a classified felon (if he could be traced, that is).L.J. Smith did well in ending the story with no conclusion (which she has promised the fans would come at the end of the series for years; ten years later and still nothing). Ash needs room to grow in order to be someone Mary-Lynnette will not regret willingly falling in love with.This is a good book, by no means the best, but excellent for the series. It was the second book I read (no, Secret Vampire was not the first) and ultimately the one that got me hooked.Here's to hoping the Mary-Lynnette/Ash fans get closure in the near future. Publishers, don't keep faithful fans in suspense!"
462,"I, LOVE this book. It is by far the best of L.J.Smiths Night World books. I can only find one flaw. No-one, and i mean no-one would just let a hunky guy like Ash just walk away? I mean Come On! As if. OK so what he's done some bad things but hey, you'll get over it. What if something happens to him while he's away and the last thing you said was ""nice line"". But okay that's fine, you wanna let him go? OK. But when do we get to find out if and when he and Mary Lynette get back together? That's just mean not telling us that. But besides that downfall the book was excellent and I love the way L.J.Smith described how they all turned really beautiful after they had fed. Heeheehee.Neways gotta go, hope you all enjoy/d the book as much as I did.Jess"
463,"This is my favorite book in L.J. Smith's uniformly excellent Night World Series. I've read it about a million times, and it never gets tired. I love the romance between Mary Lynette and Ash. The idea of soulmates is very exciting, and the scenes between the two of them are perfect. My favorite part is when Mary Lynette quotes Pride and Prejudice and Ash responds the same way, shocking her. Sigh. If you haven't read this book, get thee to a bookstore, a library, whatever and start right away!"
464,"In Daughters of Darkness, LJ Smith outdoes herself. Three beautiful sisters hide a deadly secret that threatens to be discovered by the inhabitants of a sleepy town. Rowan, Kestrel and Jade are on the run - from their families and from the Elders. They know that their brother Ash (James' cousin from Secret Vampire) is seeking them and that he is bent on returning them to the boring life they have led.Two siblings chance upon their secret and find themselves befriending vampires. As they learn more about the Night World, their own lives are turned upside down by a sickening deed. Who or what is it that stalks Briar Creek?Fantastic! I enjoyed this book immensely with its portrayal of two very different and yet similar families. The obvious difference is the species but the vampire girls have never had true freedom before while Mary-Lynette and Mark have lived their lives in a small town in the country. The similarities lie in the older sisters. Both fiercely protective of their siblings, they will do anything to keep them from harm.I loved the conflict between Ash and M'Lin, especially when they first meet. The story progressed well and unlike some stories, had a more convincing ending, rather than the sudden death of the baddie. This was one of my favourites in the series and I am still waiting anxiously for Strange Fate, which is the 10th."
465,"I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
466,"Daughters of Darkness is quite possibly the best book in the new NIGHT WORLD series by L. J. Smith. It does not just revolve around one supernatural being or one singular person, it has interesting information on the werewolves of the NIGHT WORLD and the plot line is out of sight. I own all of the books in the series (Up untill Soulmate that is) and so far Daughters of Darkness is the best one. I only hope the following books in this wonderful series are as great as this one!!"
467,"This second book in the Night World series does not compare with the first, but is good in it's own right. The three sisters are intriguing, and Ash, who was introduced in the first book, does a turnabout and becomes a guy any girl would want to marry. Overall, this book was very good, and for the vampire lover, a must read"
468,"Compared to the rest of the Nightworld Series it's on a par with The Chosen, that's to say it's good but it's no Witchlight. The best thing about this one is that it centres around everyone's favourite Bad Boy Ash. His soulmate seems like a bit of a weakling at first but you'll soon warm to her."
469,"Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it."
470,"STARNGE FATE come out already! i've been waiting for this book for like a millenium.! oh yah, where was i? DOD is a superb book and i really loved Ash and ML. they are two drastically different characters except for their love for the night and as ML says, &quot;basically incompatible with each other...&quot;! well, i agree with that . they're even dif. in terms of looks and thinking. one black one white. no wonder there is so much problems circling this pair of soulmates. even on the net, i notice most of the fanfics are about ML and Ash and their *swoon* neverending love for ach other. however, they are AWFULLY insecure bout each other. i really hope Ms. Smith will write a book about them to clear up the loose ends........... well, not a boo maybe. but a loong part in a book to let us know the final of this love tragedy? *HOPEFUL*"
471,"This book was the best out of the whole series. The book was pretty much about Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel, three girl vampires that just had enough of the Night World. Mary-Lynnette is a small town girl who loves to look at the stars, but has nobody to look at the stars with her. Ash is a tall, lanky, and elegant vampire that has to find his sisters and bing them back home. But of course his sisters had told Mary-Lynnette and her brother, Mark, bout the Night World. Another twist in the story is that Ash and Mary-Lynnette are soulmates. If this story couldn't get anymore exciting there is a vampire killer running around town. All six of them has to figure out who this vampire killer is and stop him. Meanwhile Ash and Mary-Lynnette has to figure out what to do about each other. If you like or are obsess with vampires (Like me!)you should read this book."
472,"You might have read a lot of vampire-romance novels but this one certainly rates a 10. The story itself has a good plot and amazing characters to suit their purposes. The three sisters, Rowan, Kestrel and Jade, uncannily beatiful, are actually fugitives from Night World and their brother Ash is sent to take them home. Both male and female lead role are superb. Their roles fit them perfectly. Ash, a vampire whose whole life changed after finding his soulmate is a human and Mary-Lynette a girl with a strong character who wasn't really willing to accept the fact that Ash is her soulmate. And of course...the way the authour tells her story and the words she uses..it's absolutely incredible."
473,this is one of my faviotites from the night wolrd series. i luv all of l.j. smiths books. they have a ceartin twist that sets them apart from all the other books neweyz...Ash hates humans he thinks their vermin and he is loooking for his three sisters that ran away from the night world...his three sisters(not human either) went to live with there grandmother only to find she is dead and when they bury her secretly some one is watching...a human saw them and can not believe her eyes but her brother(also human) thinks she is imagening things....and they come togher to try to find out who killed the grandma but at a very high priceits a very good book i recommened it! 8P
474,"I thought Kestrel was pretty cool, but overall, this book was definitely NOT one of LJ's best. HELLO!!! HOw could pretty much everyone here rate this book 9-10???? It was NOT THAT GOOD. My reason is because MARY-LYNETTE S****D&gt; she was another one of LJ's cheesy perfect charactesr and the fact taht she ended up with the vampire hottie was blah, too predictable. It was way too &quot;Happy Ending&quot; for me."
475,I thought this book was cleverly written and very enjoyable...and I just finished it 5 minutes ago! Very good...
476,"I loved this book!!!!!Both me and my best bud Sadia agree that this is probably one of LJSmiths best books.It has everything from romance to mystery--and even though Ash was so terrible in Secret Vampire-you cant help but fall in love with him in this. I hope that we can read more about Ash later. Also, all the girls in this book have really strong characters and you can totally relate to them. Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!"
477,"This book is incredible. It had me hooked from the very beginning. Why does everyone always say that they're in love with Ash? He's a great character, but not perfect in any way. Okay, ehough chit-chat. Read this book, I am serious. Rowan (my favorite!), Kestral, Jade, and Mary-Lynnette are just about the strongest female characters I have read in some time. I can find no flaw in any part of this book, and if you haven't already, READ IT!"
478,This is like the best book of the whole Night World series. I've read all of them and L. J. Smith is one great author. This is my total fave of the series cuz I just luv Ash. He has to be the hottest soulmate out of the whole series followed by Thierry. There just has to be another book with Ash and Mary-Lynette. If I were her I would definitely go with Ash. Mary-Lynette and Ash are perfect for each other both are so lonely and like the stars.
479,"This was one of the best in the whole Night World series, in my opinion. It was interesting, and kept you hooked until the very last page! I hope LJS writes more just like this one!"
480,I loved this book. It was hard to put down. Ash has a weird attitude and is into nepotism but gets out of the habit. In secret Vampire he was sort of more into himself and kind-of portrayed as the relitive that you wish you never had. But in this book he mends his ways. I really recommend this book and the rest of the series. Gurgi
481,"In Secret Vampire you think of Ash as the villian but in Daughters of Darkness you find out that you're way wrong. He is simply a little too self absorbed... but he is very, very, funny. You want to smack Mary Lyynete for not going with. I also liked Jade the twit, Kestrel the fierce, and Rowan the wise. An excelant read."
482,I love all her books every single solitary series! This was the first of her books I have ever read and it got me hooked i am buying it as soon as I can to add to my collection (I almost stole it from the library!) There has too be a sequal just to see waht happens (I have read other NW books but all it has is him mopeing everywhere trying to be good not evil) IT IS THE BEST IF YOU DONT OWN IT GET IT ASAP LIKE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
483,"This is the funniest Night World book. Ash is just so funny and has really werid things t2 say, def. the weridest night world person around. If anything, you've got 2 read it 4 Ash."
484,"I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of read it about 50 times, really! It's such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times! But it didn't really explain how Jeramey got there. How would he how where they were going?"
485,"This book is my favorite one. I've read it eight times. All of L.J. Smith's books are fantastic; she's my absolute favorite writer. Her writing style is very natural and realistic and her characters are so real, you start looking for them in real life. I fell in love with Ash, especially in how, even though he's a fierce vampire, he's completely helpless when it comes to Mary Lynette. Smith writes the most wonderful characters. I never liked fantasy or romance novels, but her books are a notable exception. My friends think I'm crazy because I'm in college and I'm still reading YA books, but, I'm telling you, her books are ageless!!! If you haven't read this, you're definitely missing out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
486,"Thought you would never ever fall in love? So did the hero (if you can call him that) of this story. Ash doesn't particularly like the idea of having to chase his little sisters across the country after they ran away from home. And when he finds them he doesn't exactly love the idea that they have also told humans about the Night World, a secret society of the supernatural. Or the idea that his youngest sister is in love with a human. But what's worse is Ash's soulmate is a smart, beautiful human from a hick town who hates him and everything he stands for. Also, what's worse, his great-aunt is killed with a stake meaning that somebody knew she was a vampire. All this adds up to the worst thing that can happen to a teenage boy who wants to prove that he hates humans, loves fast cars and even faster girls. This is the funniest, most ludicrous book you could ever expect to read from L.J.Smith. The characters are SOO familiar, you might expect to see them in school the next day. A must read for readers of all ages and COMEDY CENTRAL lovers."
487,"L J really outdid herself this time, this was undoubtedly one of the best books she has ever written. if you dont have this book, or don't like it, there is something serouisly wrong with your head, and you need to go see a doctor ASAP!!! I love the part where Ash and Beth are walking in the woods. What they both say and do are and is soooooo roamanitic. I always wish that the night world were real!! I wish I could have a vampire soulmate, the idea of becoming a vampire is really cool, i would love to become one. I don't know whats wrong with Beath!! You can tell Ash loves her from almost the begining.. the first time I read the book, i didnt get one part, but as u can see, i'm not dissing the book for it... the part where ash says &quot;Look...I might as well tell you. I didn't ask for this, and if somebody had said last week that I'd be in...involved... with a human, I'd have knocked his head off. I mean, after howels of derisive laughter. But.&quot; I doidn't catch what he was origenally goning to say... I'd be in LOVE, but he paused and changed the word love to involved. so while she sat there hating him, he loved her!! How blind can a girl get!! theres a fine guy there trippin over her, and she kickes him in the shin!!! twice!oh well. what I really want it a sequel though. I am just dien wonderin what happens. the lasy part where he said goodbye was soo good. If L J ever stops writing I am going to be sooooooo sad. but in conclusion, this was one of her best books. And hey, if u know any of her fan club addresses, e-mail me. I only just discovered the wonder that is LJ Smith. I only have 4 of her books, but am ordering the rest soon. THANK Y O U ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
488,OK I love L.J smiths books not to mention her name because its mine to but anyway She just has to write a sequel with Ash in it I mean who wouldnt' want to be with ash? And If I were Mary I would want to be a vampire I think she should change her mind I mean LISA Please write a sequil I mean You already know it will be bought by how many people wanting it Oh and if you do Thank you so very much.and if anyone has information about her fan clubs could you send it to me please?
489,"I am hopelessly in love with Ash Redfern.I dream at night about being Mary-Lynnette and having him as a soulmate.I read this book 2 times a week,inbetween other books I try to read.I love all LJS books and belong to several of her fan clubs.If you want the address to one of her fan clubs e-mail me."
490,"Man if only it were real.I am totally into this.I spend ALL my spare time reading these books.This book was very cool!I am in total love with James, Quinn, and Theirry.L.J. SMITH should make movies out of these books.I would spend any amount of money to see them.My best friend is so in love with Ash."
491,"Why can't there be guys like Nick, Julian, Gabriel and especially Ash? I am so in love with all of them!"
492,"Why can't Ash be real? I am so in love with him. I think L.J. Smith should stop writing the Night World series. Its watered down. The only really good book was Daughters of Darkness (the Chosen was good too) I think she should stick to triologies, so we can become really attached to those characters, i.e. Julian (still not over his death) Gabriel, Nick, and Stefan. Read all of her trilogies...even better than all her Night World stuff."
493,"L.J. Smith is the best author in the whole world. I read this book a year ago but I can't stop reading it. It is beyond sweet. I love Ash.The entire Night World seris is the bomb. I read mostly everyone of L.J Smiths book and they all are awesome. I think Ash and Mary Lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates. I loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldn't. There should be real guys like Ash,Quinn,Juliun,Damon,Gabriel and I can go on forever. I think everyone should read at least one L.J Smith book. If you do you'll be hooked on them for life,like I am. L.J Smith is the BEST!!!!"
494,"I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called &quot;Daughters of Darkness&quot; when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???"
495,"I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
496,This book is exciting It's a turn pager you can't put it down.You think one thing will happen yet it does'nt. I think Smith did a wonderful job on this
497,"Ash. Ahh. Such a great guy. Mary-Lynette, she's a little wary(At first) and then at the end loves him passionatly. Can't blame her. Quinn sends him to bring back Ash's 3 sisters. Mark, Mary's younger brother, falls in love with Jade. She's one of the sisters along with her two older ones, Rowan and Kestrel. I'm sure you'll love it. I did"
498,"We've fallen head over heels in love with Ash! I wish he was real, minus his feeding habits. Possibly the best book that we have read, and definitely the best Night World book so far! Every morning we check in the mirror for any signs of fangs. So far, none have appeared. Unfortunately. If anyone knows the way to join the Night World, let us know! We're DYING to be part of it. Literally. If you don't read it, then we're sending Ash after you! Watch out, he's very hungry tonight!Elf and Zelia"
499,"Three beautiful sisters (named Rowan, Kestrel and Jade Redfurn) move into Briar Creek, Oregon right next to Mark and Mary-Lynette Carter.Then, Mary-Lynette and Mark follow the sisters into the woods and discover that they are vampire fugitives from the Night World, a secret society vampires, werewolves, witches, changelings and other creatures of darkness.And Jade breakes the Night World laws by falling in love with Mark.But Rowan, Kestrel and Jade's ruthless vampire brother, Ash Rudfurn, has been sent to take his sisters back to the island where they came from.But when he falls in love with Mary-Lynette he wants to take her into the Night World"
